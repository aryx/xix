(* An Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for C.
 * 
 * The AST below does not match exactly the source code; I do a few
 * simplications at parsing time:
 *  - no nested struct definitions; they are lifted to the toplevel and 
 *    a blockid is associated with the tag name to avoid name conflicts
 *  - no anonymous structure; an artificial name is gensym'ed.
 *  - no anonymous structure element; an artificial field name is gensym'ed
 *  - no mix of typedefs with variable declarations;
 *    again typedefs are lifted to the top
 *  - enums are also lifted to the top (and its constants are tagged with
 *    a blockid)
 * 
 * This AST is actually more a named AST (but not a typed AST). 
 * Indeed, in C, you can not separate completely the naming phase from parsing.
 * The grammar of C has an ambiguity with typedefs, so we need to keep track of 
 * typedefs and identifiers and their scope during parsing. It would be
 * redundant to do this work again in a separate naming phase, so I 
 * name and resolve the scope of identifiers at parsing time
 * (however I check for inconsistencies or redefinitions after parsing).
 * Moreover, because I lift up struct definitions, I also keep track
 * and resolve the scope of tags.
 * 
 * See also pfff/lang_c/parsing/ast_c.ml and pfff/lang_cpp/parsing/ast_cpp.ml
 * 
 * todo: 
 *  - have a (large) integer and (large) double for Int and Float?
 *    Int64.t? if unsigned long long constant? enough? overflow in int64_of_str?
 *)
