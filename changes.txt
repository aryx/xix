* TODO
fix o5c for helloc.exe

** rc/mk
TODO Can use rc/mk on principia and build and syncweb as well Editor.nw/Codemap.nw
  need implement globbing, subshell, etc.

** internals

** devinfra

** testinfra

* -----------------------------------------------------------

* 0.17 (Q4 2025) (ELF Linux, va/vl v0, ar/nm v0, Dockerfile.light v1, CLI.ml and caps, semgrep GHA, libcore v0, cat/pwd/wc/... utilities, resume windows and kernel)

** general
- renamed all binaries with an 'o' prefix (for ocaml): 
  omk, orc (haha), ogit, o5a, o5l, oar, onm, etc.

** toolchain
- support for ELF and Linux code generation in o5l and got hello_linux_arm.exe
  working! (and also the simpler exit_linux_arm.exe)
- start of multi-arch assembler/linker/compiler detecting arch with argv0
- port va (plan9 mips assembler) to OCaml (now called ova)
- partial port of vl (plan9 mips linker) to OCaml (now called ovl)
  enough for exit_linux_mips.exe and hello_linux_mips.exe to work!
- port ar to OCaml (v0) (now called oar)
- port nm to OCaml (v0) (now called onm)
- port of the -p and -p_count (was called -p -1 in kencc) basic profiling
  instrumentation in o5l/ovl/... (the code is now mostly generic)

** libcore
- compile our own stdlib (mostly a copy from ocaml-light stdlib)
  thanks to -nostdlib (and -nopervasives) with refined orga
  lib_core/{base,core,collections,printing,regexps,parsing}
- move sha1 and zip/unzip from vcs to new lib_core/{crypto,compression}
- import ocaml-re in lib_core/regexps/re/ and split files for
  some better separation of concerns

** utilities
- new utilities/ with cat, pwd, and wc OCaml port (called ocat, opwd, ...)

** testinfra
- Dockerfile.light can now compile also 5a/5c/5l/cpp
  thx to the removal of the use of 'as' in the .mll files
  ('as' is not supported by ocaml-light ocamlllex)
- Dockerfile.light can now compile lib_graphics/, windows/, kernel/, utilities/
  so almost all OCaml code in xix now compiles with ocaml-light!
  (only exception is vcs/ which require Int32.ml and custom blocks porting);
  orio and o9 are not running yet, but at least they compile.

** devinfra
- resume semgrep.jsonnet and semgrep.yml in CI and forbid more constructs
  (e.g., Obj.magic, forbid more caps related functions)
- use more Logs.info in 5a/5l/...

** docs
- started lpization of xix programs with oas.nw, olk.nw, occ.nw,
  orio.nw (in addition to the now renamed omk.nw, orc.nw)

** internals
- use uppercase module filenames, split Main.ml/CLI.ml, and start
  to use capabilities for 5a/5c/5l/cpp as well as lex/yacc
- use Cap.open_out, started new Cap.draw, Cap.keyboard, Cap.mouse
  and Cap.mount, Cap.bind for orio
- use more Chan.{i,o} types to reduce the need for Cap.open_{in,out}
- resume the compilation of windows/ and kernel/ with dune and mkfile
  without requiring a plan9 ocamlc


* 0.16 (Q3 2025) (Dockerfile.light v0)

** testinfra
- Finish Dockerfile.light that can compile {mk,rc,lib_core/commons} with
  ocaml-light! see ocaml-light/changes.txt for all the stuff that was needed

* 0.15 (Q2 2025) (Cap.ml, Dockerfile/Nix/Testo (testinfra), dune/merlin/ocamlformat (tools))
# Resume again after one year of inactivity due to my work on Semgrep.
# Bring again like last year good stuff I learned from Semgrep:
#  - Cap.ml! capabilities!! XiX can innovate not only on being far smaller, and
#    also have literate documents, but also because it uses capabilities in apps!
#  - Console.ml, Chan.ml (and UConsole.ml/UChan.ml)
#  - Dockerfile (and GHA) for reproducible tangible build instructions
#  - Nix (and GHA) for another reproducible tangible build instructions
#    and even cross-platform CI checks for Linux and macOS
#  - ppx_deriving (instead of ocamltarzan and OCaml.ml)
#  - Fpath.t (instead of Common.filename)
#  - dune (and good ocaml warnings and also far faster build time in //)
#  - merlin for code navigation (requires dune)
#  - Testo (snapshot-based testing)
#  (remain ocamlformat and let* that I learned at Semgrep but maybe less important)

** internals

- Start use ppx_deriving (which then require OCaml 4.09.1 but
  it should be doable to implement a poor's man deriving in ocaml-light)
  We generate some dummy show_xxx so that boostrap-mk.sh can still
  compile correctly the code (ppx_deriving is mostly used in Logs anyway)
- Copy Cap.ml from semgrep and start using capabilities!!! (and
  augmented semgrep.jsonnet to forbid Sys.xxx) (which then requires OCaml 4.0x
  but again it is doable to just skip any object constructs in ocaml light
  as capabilities are just a typechecking thing without runtime impact).
- capabilties: Cap.fork, Cap.exec, Cap.exit, Cap.chdir, Cap.stdout, Cap.argv
  and new Cap.env, Cap.open_in
- integrate Console.ml, CapConsole.ml, UConsole.ml from semgrep
- copy Chan.ml, UChan.ml, CapProcess, and CapFS.ml from semgrep
- Start use poor's man Fpath.ml instead of Common.filename
- Start use capitalized module for lib_core/commons/, mk/, shell/ (thx Martin)
- use dune as an additional way to build XiX which then allows to
  use merlin and code navigation in efuns!!
- use ocamlformat (just on some .mli for now)
- adapt the code to also work with ocaml-light! (remove some labels,
  remove some Int32/Int64 code, etc.)

** testinfra

- Dockerfile (Ubuntu because Alpine is failing for old OCaml versions)
  and docker.yml GHA (GitHub Actions) CI
- shell.nix Nix dev environment setup
  and nix.yml GHA CI
- start of use of Testo and snapshots for e2e testing of rc
- Dockerfile.light to compile again but using ocaml light!
  (my own fork of ocaml 1.07 (which is roughly caml-special-light since
  I've removed the objects part))

* -----------------------------------------------------------

* 0.14 (Q2 2024) (Logging, Testing, CI)

** testinfra
- mk works again (but need rc from plan9port (a.k.a. 9base in Linux))

** devinfra
- Logging using poor's man Logs.ml

* 0.13 (Q1 2024) (CI build and test and semgrep checks (testinfra))
# Resume after long hiatus (2019-2023) due to our move to Italy,
# the birth of Nathalie, and especially my work for Semgrep.
# Bring good stuff I learned from semgrep:
#  - GHA and CI regression testing
#  - Logs
#  - Semgrep checks (and semgrep.jsonnet)
#  - tests

** internals
- Started to use stdcompat for backward compatibility with
  old versions of OCaml.

** testinfra
- Github Actions (GHA) checks to make sure xix compiles.
  At least it compiles with 3.10.0 (thx to stdcompat), 4.04.0, 4.14.0,
  and even 5.1.0!
- some basic tests (also enforced in GHA) in test.sh

** devinfra
- first semgrep checks in semgrep.jsonnet :) and semgrep GHA workflow.

* -----------------------------------------------------------

* Big pause to work on semgrep for 2019/2020/2021/2022/2023

  or from entirely new code for the features not implemented by dulwich.

port of rio using ocaml threads but relying on the original plan9 kernel.
basic terminal emulator.

port of libdraw, the userspace part, again relying on the original plan9 kernel
(draw/, geometry/, input/, and basic ui/ for menus)

binding to plan9 mount/bind and port of 9P protocol to ocaml (for rio)
(lib_system/)

import stdlib and organize better lib_core/ (collections/, string/, etc).

port more of the kernel C code to ocaml 
(core DS, concurrency, memory, process, interrupts, virtual memory,
scheduling, and timing chapters).

started lib_core/ 

* 0.5 (Q1 2017) (kernel start)
# Giogio birth!

minimal C kernel for Raspberry Pi (boot, malloc, libc, print) by
 selecting subset of 9/bcm/ and 9/port in plan9

 by linking the byterun interpreter from ocaml light 1.07 to the
 minimal C kernel (incorporate more libc)

import of lex from OCaml.
import of lib_parsing/ from the modifications I made to lex and yacc.
