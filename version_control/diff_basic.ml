(* Basic Diff algorithm based on the computation of the edit distance between
 * two strings (also known as the Longuest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem).
 * 
 * reference: 
 * "Algorithms on Strings, Trees, and Sequences" by Dan Gusfield, P217.
 * 
 * For two strings S1 and S2, D(i,j) is defined to be the edit distance 
 * of S1[1..i] to S2[1..j].
 * So the edit distance of S1 (of length n) and S2 (of length m) is D(n,m).
 * 
 * Dynamic programming technique
 * base: 
 *  D(i,0) = i  for all i 
 *   because to go from S1[1..i] to 0 characters of S2 you have to 
 *   delete all the characters from S1[1..i]
 *  D(0,j) = j  for all j 
 *    because j characters must be inserted
 * recurrence:
 *  D(i,j) = min([D(i-1, j)+1, 
 *                D(i, j-1)+1, 
 *                D(i-1, j-1) + t(i,j)])
 *   where t(i,j) is equal to 1 if S1(i) != S2(j) and  0 if equal
 * 
 *  Intuition = there are 4 possible actions:
 *    deletion, insertion, substitution, or match
 *  so Lemma =
 *   D(i,j) must be one of the three
 *     D(i, j-1) + 1
 *     D(i-1, j)+1 
 *     D(i-1, j-1) + 
 *       t(i,j) 
 * 
 * history: done in summer 2007 for Julia Lawall
 * 
 * complexity: O(nm) in time and space, so if you want to diff two
 * sequences of more than 10 000 elts, it will requires a matrix with
 * 100 M and 100 M operations, so this is not very scalable 
 * (see Myers's algorithm used in GNU diff for a more scalable algorithm).

(* Optimization *)
(*****************************************************************************)
(* Actually this is not a big win. On files of 20 000 LOC, you
 * go from 125s to 118s, so the string comparison in matrix_distance()
 * is not the bottleneck.
 * Actually in native mode you go from 33s to 35s so this is even
 * slowing things down, weird.

(* other optimizations:
 *  - strip common lines in the front and end (McIlroy diff was doing that)
 *    so can reduce significantly the size of the matrix
 *  - Use Hirschberg space opti of storing only the last row.
 *    No need for full matrix to determine the next row (but then
 *    need to be clever to get the traceback).
