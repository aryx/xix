* 0.10 (Q2 2018) ()

* 0.9 (Q1 2018) (GioGio at home a lot)

* -----------------------------------------------------------

* 0.8 (Q4 2017) (git algorithms)

diff3.ml
simpler diff_myers.ml

* 0.7 (Q3 2017) (git)

port of dulwich and ocaml-git, 2 clones of git, to ocaml(light). 
Simplify code in ocaml-git by not using functors/lwt/mstruct/... 
and complete with new code derived from dulwich (clone of git in python)
or from entirely new code for the features not implemented by dulwich.


* 0.6 (Q2 2017) (rio and libdraw, import lib_core, lib_system)

port of rio using ocaml threads but relying on the original plan9 kernel.
basic terminal emulator.

port of libdraw, the userspace part, again relying on the original plan9 kernel
(draw/, geometry/, input/, and basic ui/ for menus)

binding to plan9 mount/bind and port of 9P protocol to ocaml (for rio)
(lib_system/)

import stdlib and organize better lib_core/ (collections/, string/, etc).

port more of the kernel C code to ocaml 
(core DS, concurrency, memory, process, interrupts, virtual memory,
scheduling, and timing chapters).

started lib_core/ 

* 0.5 (Q1 2017) (kernel start)

minimal C kernel for Raspberry Pi (boot, malloc, libc, print) by
 selecting subset of 9/bcm/ and 9/port in plan9
minimal ocaml hello world linked in kernel
 by linking the byterun interpreter from ocaml light 1.07 to the
 minimal C kernel (incorporate more libc)

* -----------------------------------------------------------

* 0.4 (Q4 2016) (5c typechecker and basic code generator)

finish cpp
finish first port of 5c (typechecker and basic code generator)

* 0.3 (Q3 2016) (mk, rc, 5c parser, cpp)

port of mk
port of rc
port of 5c (just parser and dumper)
port of cpp

* 0.2 (Q2 2016) ()

* 0.1 (Q1 2016) (5l)

start of repository, mkfiles, skeleton

port of 5l
finish 5a

* -----------------------------------------------------------

* Alpha (Dec 2015) (5a + lex/yacc import)

port of 5a
import of yacc that I ported in may 2015
import of lex from OCaml.
import of lib_parsing/ from the modifications I made to lex and yacc.
