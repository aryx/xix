# We could have Set.ml and Map.ml below. It would work with ocamlc, but
# not with ocamlopt :( so not worth the trouble.
# Also it makes it easier to see what is non-standard.
# history: Set_.ml and Map_.ml were in a separate lib_core/collections
# before but simpler to merge with commons for just those two files
# and to free lib_core/collections/ for the ocaml stdlib collection files
