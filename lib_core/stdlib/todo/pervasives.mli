(* Module [Pervasives]: the initially opened module *)

(* This module provides the built-in types (numbers, booleans,
   strings, exceptions, references, lists, arrays, input-output channels, ...)
   and the basic operations over these types.

   This module is automatically opened at the beginning of each compilation.
   All components of this module can therefore be referred by their short
   name, without prefixing them by [Pervasives]. *)

           apply. The arguments are the location of the pattern-matching
           in the source code (file name, position of first character,
           position of last character). *)
exception Assert_failure of (string * int * int)
        (* Exception raised when an assertion fails.  The arguments are
           the location of the pattern-matching in the source code

(*- exception Stack_overflow *)
        (* Exception raised by the bytecode interpreter when the evaluation
           stack reaches its maximal size. This often indicates infinite

           an operating system error. *)

           when their second argument is null. *)

           if and only if their current contents are structurally equal,
           even if the two mutable objects are not the same physical object.
           Equality between functional values raises [Invalid_argument].
           Equality between cyclic data structures may not terminate. *)

           numbers, and extend them to a total ordering over all types.

           of [(=)], mutable structures are compared by contents.

           [x<y], and a positive integer if [x>y]. The same restrictions
           as for [=] apply. [compare] can be used as the comparison function
           required by the [Set] and [Map] modules. *)
val min: 'a -> 'a -> 'a
        (* Return the smaller of the two arguments. *)

        (* [e1 == e2] tests for physical equality of [e1] and [e2].
           On integers and characters, it is the same as structural
           equality. On mutable structures, [e1 == e2] is true if and only if
           physical modification of [e1] also affects [e2].
           On non-mutable structures, the behavior of [(==)] is
           implementation-dependent, except that [e1 == e2] implies
           [e1 = e2]. *)

           [e2] is not evaluated at all. *)
external (||) : bool -> bool -> bool = "%sequor"
        (* The boolean ``or''. Evaluation is sequential, left-to-right:
           in [e1 or e2], [e1] is evaluated first, and if it returns [true],
           [e2] is not evaluated at all. *)

external (&) : bool -> bool -> bool = "%sequand"
external (or) : bool -> bool -> bool = "%sequor"

(*** Integer arithmetic *)

(* Integers are 31 bits wide (or 63 bits on 64-bit processors).
   All operations are taken modulo $2^{31}$ (or $2^{63}$).
   They do not fail on overflow. *)

external (lsr) : int -> int -> int = "%lsrint"
        (* [n lsr m] shifts [n] to the right by [m] bits.

        (* [n asr m] shifts [n] to the right by [m] bits.
           This is an arithmetic shift: the sign bit of [n] is replicated. *)

(*** Floating-point arithmetic *)

(* On most platforms, Caml's floating-point numbers follow the
   IEEE 754 standard, using double precision (64 bits) numbers.
   Floating-point operations do not fail on overflow or underflow,
   but return denormal numbers. *)
