* Elm playground Last
# see also elm-playground-ocaml/todo.txt

** see Code classics Vol1 and Vol2 that I recently bought.
Port them from python to OCaml and reuse its assets.

** port Core wars from dewdney to ocaml-elm-playground!
see software-src/emulator/pmars/

Core war implementation in OCaml? with Graphics? See Armchair universe
articles

** https://github.com/KDE/kde1-kdegames

** Web version

*** words (for pong and when crash in snake)

*** polygons (for asteroid)

*** WEIRD stalling Tetris, not even an element

*** WEIRD fix bounding box not always the right one, which leads to 
flickering on Mouse.html
also on Mario.html

*** port fps function?

** publish

*** publish some games via pages.github.com (for access at xxx.github.io)
just put the .html and generated .bc.js!

*** announce ocaml-elm-playground on discuss! and OPAM!
https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/it-there-a-tutorial-for-js-of-ocaml-with-simple-graphics/4636/3

** Finish Playground.ml

*** MouseClick reset at Tick, but after ran update_memory callback

*** Keyboard issues

**** Keyboard reset at Tick?
do same with certian keys? like space?
alt: or just augment Tick? so less fps but less run of update_state?
alt: make keyboard stuff mutable?

add delta also in computer? or again just rely on a better Tick?

**** finish keyboard handling, too fast!
why? need reset the down? nah

reduce Tick to less frames! 60 fps max!
call new view only when animationFrame/Tick!

How does Elm do?

**** make keyboard stuff mutable? so when read the key, can reset
it to emulate keydown/keyup?
not pure, but would work :) or need use ref instead of mutable?
how does Playground.elm handles that?

**** why get multiple keydown SDL event when I keep the key pressed?

** read more about physics
physics explanations, looks really great tutorials
http://gamemechanicexplorer.com/
or physics for games book oreilly?

** docs on game libs
http://phaser.io/ framework for games, helps to see the important concepts
needed in a game

** port more games to my ocaml-elm-playground
# port enough games to battle-test ocaml-elm-playground and be feature-rich
#  enough to announce it at christmas :)
#see-also: todo/games.txt

*** finish asteroids

**** polygon shape collision detection
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1560492/how-to-tell-whether-a-point-is-to-the-right-or-left-side-of-a-line

**** maybe black background and random stars drawn

*** port raycaster?

*** port breakout
the atari 2600 clone looks good

*** fix alpha bug with turtle.png from imagelib
#at least web version should work

use git latest, they said they fixed the alpha for PNG!:
install from source: https://github.com/rlepigre/ocaml-imagelib

see https://github.com/rlepigre/ocaml-imagelib/issues/42#issuecomment-752053204

*** WAITING pbs with loading gif from internet, 
#at least web version should work

get convert backend of imagelib working? Do it myself? 
also size seems wrong for mario gif when displayed on screen

** write toy app using Revery using OCaml syntax?
#or maybe ok to write a bit of ReasonML, just for the UI anyway
# especially when efuns with merlin offers type-hover info and goto-def

** try compile efuns for revery?
=> can use the fancy 80's syntwave fonts!
#a pain though to install. super big, does not work with opam (at least
#works with dune)

** link pfff code with revery?
=> can use efuns/codemap on my mac! finally!
better code? easier UI? FRP/ELM wins?

** less: look at SAFE for F#, which darklang is prototyping things in
install dotnet?

* Elm playground

** finish Playground.ml

*** less: add delta time in Playground.elm in computer in addition to time?

*** port Time.every tickFrequency?

** Go beyond Playground.ml

*** how create initial game page in native? stuff that would be trivial
in html with on Click event.
=> need port HTML/VDom to native?

or just have first page explaining stuff using Cairo.draw_text
and the rest the game.

*** cross-platform GUI? Html/VDom port in native!
Need cross-platform gui? a la vdom?
vbox, hbox, button, etc? and generate either raw cairo or SDL
or html?

https://github.com/sanette/bogue
for OCaml and SDL2! perfect. Use tsdl.

port the one in plan9? another xix brick! :)

https://github.com/actsl/kiss_sdl

ocaml-raylib better?

https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/tasks !!!
 nice bench, like todomvc a bit

*** cross-platform physics library
needed for rolling_moon

port that simple elm library? https://github.com/jastice/boxes-and-bubbles !!

** Native version

*** still bugs with translate/rotate/scale of forms?

** Web version

*** less: onResize subscription?
in Picture Animation and Game

* Porting games

** port more games to my ocaml-elm-playground

*** port space invaders
the first one on rofl-elm looks good, but svg
weird paths to define the ufo

will need load png? 
OR define sprite library!
define sprite via array, inline, and
then scale that to the screen appropriately.
draw lots of little squares :)
16x16? simple. can even draw it in picture mode?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(computer_graphics)

read yampa arcade?

*** port pacman
not listed on rofl-elm-games: https://github.com/kghandhi/pacman

will definitely need load png!

*** port turtle-like API a la Logo and draw
classic set of pictures (fractals, square, etc.)

*** port karel the robot stuff?

*** see mini-sdl2-games by fccm
just pong (just pong0), snake, shmup, chainrxn

*** rolling moon?
physics engine?
need understand the code first
see the easy engine in ELM circles and boxes

*** RELAX see software-src/games/  educational games especially
haskell games, ocaml games, elm games

look mamedb page, with the different categories

** port more (elm) games
#use philip2 to translate?
https://github.com/rofrol/elm-games

* Later

** later: write Games.nw!!
publish via stog? or plain jekyll
new backend for syncweb ? -to_html? medium style? jekyll enough?
markdown enough?

** later: write Soldat using Playground.elm!
need port also elm 2d engine? pixelengine? poco8?

see todo/soldat.txt

** later: port also openGL/webGL
for native use tgls?
https://github.com/dbuenzli/tgls/blob/master/test/trigl3.ml

https://github.com/lucamug/elm-playground-3d
https://medium.com/@l.mugnaini/basic-3d-rendering-in-svg-elm-playground-3d-d1e8846cd06e
 but seems a hack, it projects on 2d surface, does not provide
 automatic shadows etc.
