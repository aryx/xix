%thx to LP, I changed for the better a few things:

%   (dulwich has a big porcelain.py and dulwich.py files, 
%    ocaml-git has just ogit.ml,
%    git has many git-xxx.c but too many; porcelain vs plumb is useless)

%thx to this manual, I better understand VCSs (and git):
% - intuition of Torvalds for a stupid content tracker with very

% - merge and MERGE_HEADS state?

\chapter{Introduction}

The goal of this book is to explain with full details the source code of
a {version control system}.

\section{Motivations}

Why a version control system (VCS)?
Because I think you are a better programmer if
you fully understand how things work under the hood, and
%dup: Make.nw
a VCS is one of the tools a programmer uses the most.
\n def, cos maybe not super well known term and can be confused with SCM
Indeed, programmers use VCSs, 
which manage {efficiently} changes to a file or set of files,
to manage the vital product of their labour: source code.

%src: SCCS paper
VCSs allow to {store} and {retrieve} past versions of a file, and to {record}
{who} made each change, {when}, {where}, and {why}.
\l Important cos program changes all the time! bugs/features/maintenance/opti
\l need 'system' to help 'control versions' otherwise chaos (said later?)
\l introduce checkin/checkout, delta so can talk about it in next section?
\l store/retrieve/track and coordinate work of multiple people.
%
VCSs are mostly used by programmers but
you can use a VCS to manage any text-based documents
(e.g., the source of this book), configuration files, and even binaries.
\n e.g., images, but not good IMHO to store binaries.
\l Word/Excel/Google-Docs/Wikipedia have their own VCS.

For projects with a single developer, a VCS is useful
to keep track of changes: it allows the programmer to easily go back to
past versions if he messed things up.
\l also git grep, git bisect, git revert, git blame, ... (said later?)
%
For projects with multiple developers, a VCS is almost mandatory:
it allows programmers to collaborate with each other and 
even to work on and modify the same files concurrently.
\l also git merge, git blame, ... (said later?)


%dup: Make.nw
\l not as interesting as kernel/compiler, but necessary!
\n bootstrapping issues (said later)
\l many nice algos. interesting study.
\t copy building-git.launchrock pitch?

Here are a few questions I hope this book will answer:
\begin{itemize}

%dup: Make.nw
\item What are the fundamental concepts of a VCS? 
\n repo (file db), commit (changeset), branches, version DAG
What are the core algorithms behind a VCS?
\n delta (diff), diff3 (merge), zip/unzip, sha1 (at least consistency check)

\item How does a VCS store efficiently multiple versions of a file?
\l store efficiently past versions of set of files
\n delta (diff), reversed-delta
%git: sha1 deduplicating (but not delta/diff really), compression,
% dedup of blob but also of (sub)trees, pack delta and compression

\item How does a VCS represent changes to a file, or changes 
to a set of files? 
\n changeset tree, other?
%git: does not record change but state!
How does a VCS represent the addition, deletion, or renaming of a file?
\n CVS Attic is a mess, git simple model for rename (del/add)

\item How does a VCS allow multiple users to work on and 
modify the same files at the same time?
\l pseudo-simultaneously (CVS uses this term)
How can a VCS help coordinate the actions of multiple users?
\l concurrent development
\n locks, merge

\item How does a VCS support parallel developments in a project?
How can
some developers work on the main release, 
some developers on experimental features, and 
others on fixing bugs on previously shipped releases 
all at the same time?
What is a branch?
How does a VCS reconcile multiple branches?
%What are the differences between concurrent and parallel development?
%src: 7 concurrency book:
% - concurrent program has multiple logical threads of control. These threads
%   may or may not run in parallel (can interleave)
% - parallel program runs more quickly than a sequential program by
%   executing different parts of the computation simultaneously (in //).
%   It may or may not have more than one logical thread of control.

\item What is a merge algorithm? When is a merge safe? 
What is a merge conflict? How does a VCS resolve conflicts?
\n it does not resolve conflicts! it lets user, too complicated, ok to delegate

\end{itemize}

%companies:
\t Important, companies invest in VCS: Facebook (mercurial, git), Google? (Perforce?),
\t  Microsoft (Sourcesafe, Visual Team Source Control, Git), Sun (TeamWare), 
\t  IBM (ClearCase)
\t Apple? amazon? netflix?

\t put in conclusion non-trivial adv algo and data structures seen? see comment
%data-structures (beyond list/hashtbl): (use lists, hashtbl)
% - crypto SHA1 DAG (authentificated from the root!) of commit
% - Merkel Trees (related to version DAG)
% - Huffman?
% - graph (DAG)

%algorithms (beyond search/sort): (appendix)
% - sha1
% - unzip (with huffman inside, adler32, lzh)
% - zip
% - diff
% - diff3 (aka merge)

%tags used in this file for different recurring themes:
 %git: git-specific stuff in early sections
 %rcs: %cvs: %sccs: good to see alternate design decisions
 %facebook: my facebook experience using a VCS (mostly SVN -> git -> hg)
 %ocaml: ocaml-specific trick or annoyance

\section{The version control system Git (and [[ocamlgit]])}
\label{sec:vcs-git-ocamlgit}

I will explain in this book the code of the VCS 
[[ocamlgit]]\furl{https://github.com/aryx/plan9-ocaml/tree/master/version_control},
which contains about 6200 lines of code (LOC).
\n [[gut]] shortand? meh, confusing. ocamlgit and git should have same UI.
%
As its name suggests, [[ocamlgit]] is written in OCaml and is a clone
of the popular VCS
Git\furl{https://git-scm.com/}, which is written in C.

As opposed to most books in \principia, I could not choose a \plan
program for this book because there are no \plan VCSs.
\l (they rely on fs?) /n/sources/? (said later?)
%
There are many open source \unix VCSs with different user interfaces, storage
strategies, concurrency models, or features. I will present
a few of those VCSs in Section~\ref{sec:other-vcs}.
%
For this book, I decided to base the presentation on Git because
Git is one of the most popular VCSs in the open source community.
Moreover, when coupled with the hosting website 
GitHub\furl{https://github.com}, 
Git makes it really easy for people to collaborate with each other.
\n mercurial/bitbucket, CVS/sourceforge/savannah but GitHub better interface
\l Cf OCaml experiment with Github vs CVS/Mantis, no match! Easy to setup.
\n  very low barrier
\l Meta: OCaml, lang of ocamlgit, now under github itself! so can use ocamlgit
\l  to get code of ocaml :)

However, Git is a rather large project with more
than 200 000 LOC. It is impossible to present all this code
in a book of a reasonable size.
%
There are a few clones of Git written in higher-level languages than C,
for example, Dulwich\furl{https://www.dulwich.io/} written
in Python with only 16 000 LOC.
%
I could have based this book on Dulwich, but this would introduce
another language in the \principia book series in addition
to C (used in most of the books) 
and OCaml (used in the editor, web browser, and code generators books).
%
This would also in turn require to present the code of the Python interpreter,
which contains more than 170 000 lines of C code.
\n and far more of Python code (not counting test and third-party C libs)
%
Instead, I decided to port the Python code of Dulwich to OCaml, resulting
in [[ocamlgit]], and to present the code of [[ocamlgit]].
\n other ocaml clones ocaml-git (said later)
\n in fact I LPized first full code of dulwich, which helped understanding it

\section{Other version control systems}
\label{sec:other-vcs}
%me: manual backups -> RCS -> CVS -> PRCS -> git -> darcs -> 
% (FB-in) SVN -> git -> hg -> (FB-out) git

Here are a few VCSs that I considered for this book, but
which I ultimately discarded:
\begin{itemize}

\item The Revision Control System
(RCS)~\cite{rcs}\furl{https://www.gnu.org/software/rcs/}
was the first open source VCS.
%history:
Like its predecessor, the Source Code Control System
(SCCS)~\cite{sccs}\furl{http://sccs.sourceforge.net/},
\n RCS closed in 1982, free in 1990? (SCCS closed in 1976, free only in 2006)
\n CSSC alternative OSS version of SCCS
RCS uses {\em deltas} to store efficiently the past versions of a file
(Section~\ref{sec:diff-algo} will present the {Diff} algorithm to compute
those deltas).
However, RCS improves over SCCS by using {\em reverse-deltas} to 
enable the user to also retrieve quickly the last version of a file
(a recurring operation).
\l but blaming is faster with SCCS

RCS is still a reasonable choice to manage a small project
with a single developer or a small set of developers who can 
share access to a common directory 
(for example, by using NFS and symbolic links).
%
However, the use of {\em locks} in RCS to forbid multiple developers
to modify the same file at the same time and its focus on individual files make
% Mostly single file. treat files separately. Each has different version. 
%  can be used for multiple files, but abuse shell (wildcard on ,v)
%  but not really good for projects with subdirs.
RCS inadequate for large projects with many independent developers.
%
Moreover, even if RCS is very limited compared to modern VCSs like Git,
RCS still contains more than 17 500 LOC.
\n (not including testsuite, but small anyway)
\l Why? too subtle diff representation?
\n has kinda branch, and rcsmerge, and tags, but hacks
\l SRC wrapper from ESR? 


\item The Concurrent Versions System
CVS~\cite{cvs}\furl{http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/}
was the most popular VCS for over a decade
before distributed VCSs (e.g., Git) took over.
%
CVS introduced a few important innovations.
\n STUG award 2003
First, CVS was designed to operate on a set of files 
at once\footnote{RCS can operate on multiple files by using shell 
wildcards, but it was not designed for it.}, 
with files possibly organized in a tree.
\n RCS cannot do that.
With CVS, you can group together related changes to a set of files 
and you can easily retrieve past versions of a whole {project}.
\l not atomic commit though, SVN fixed that (said later?)
\n can with RCS, with tags, or date, but again not really designed for
%
Secondly, CVS allows multiple users to work on and modify the same
files concurrently (hence the 'C' in CVS).
CVS relies on the [[merge]] program instead of locks
(Section~\ref{sec:diff3-algo} will present the Diff3 algorithm which
underlies the [[merge]] program).
\l who commit first always succeeds and snd needs update and merge (said later)
%
Finally, CVS introduced later in 1995 a {\em client/server} architecture 
where a {\em repository} could be stored on a remote machine.
\t should find a way to define repo before, and so no need em here
\n TCP/IP really made took off, but was done later, not in 1986.
When coupled with the free hosting site
Sourceforge\furl{https://sourceforge.net}, 
CVS allowed developers to easily start and collaborate on new projects.
\l but branch and parallel development is really tedious (said later?)

CVS started as a few shell scripts using RCS as a backend.
\n so did not need free version of RCS?
\n rewritten in C in 1990
However, today CVS is a very large C program with more than
80 000 LOC.
\l cvs 1.3 is only 17 000 LOC
\n not third-party libs (diff/zlib/lib/os2/NT/vms) and sanity.sh
The backend file [[src/rcs.s]] contains already 9000 LOC.
\l reputed difficult to understand, hence SVN

\n I presented a bit git before so needs less intro
\item Git~\cite{git-book}\furl{https://git-scm.com} was originally created
by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to manage the source code of the Linux kernel.
It followed a series of
{\em distributed VCSs} 
(e.g., TeamWare, BitKeeper, Arch, Darcs, Monotone) 
designed to overcome the main limitations of CVS (a {centralized VCS}).
%
Because a distributed VCS (DVCS) does not require access to a
central repository, it allows developers to work independently offline.
%
A DVCS makes it also easy and cheap to create {\em branches}
representing parallel developments, and to reconcile later those branches
(see Section~\ref{sec:distributed-vs-centralized} for more discussions
on the advantages of distributed VCSs over centralized VCSs).
\l has to, because everybody is a branch (said later?)
\l also atomic, consistency checks! fast! done the right way!
\l peer-to-peer (said later?)

As I explained in Section~\ref{sec:vcs-git-ocamlgit}, Git
is a large program with more than 200~000 LOC spread over more than 400 files
(not including the tests, GUIs, and extra contributions).
%
The first version of Git was small and contained only 1000 LOC\footnote{
\url{https://github.com/git/git/commit/e83c5163316f89bfbde7d9ab23ca2e25604af290}}.
However, it contained only a few low-level commands that were not easy to use.
This forced programmers to develop and use the extra program 
[[cogito]]\furl{http://git.or.cz/cogito/}, which
provided an extra layer of higher-level commands (called {\em porcelain}),
but added many more lines of code.
\t count? Now integrated in Git but Git also bigger
\l also libgit2, LOC? share code with git?

% related book:
% - https://building-git.launchrock.com/ 
%   https://shop.jcoglan.com/building-git/contents.pdf

\item Mercurial~\cite{hgbook}\furl{https://www.mercurial-scm.org/}
is another popular DVCS started also in 2005 by another 
Linux kernel programmer: Matt Mackal.
\l after BitKeeper fiasco
It is mostly written in Python and relies only on a few C files for critical
operations. Its code is arguably easier to understand than Git
but it still contains more than 100~000 LOC spread over more than 170 files
(not including the tests, extensions, and extra contributions).
\l core of 1.0 is? maybe not that bad
\l bitbucket equivalent of github

\end{itemize}

% In the end I picked a mix between git and mercurial: git, but
% implemented in the language used for mercurial (Python)
% by the guy who apparently has been involved in bazaar :)

[[ocamlgit]] is not as efficient and complete as Git or Mercurial,

%last:
% - microgit in python: https://www.leshenko.net/p/ugit/
%   why not dulwich??

%industry:
% - Perforce
% - Rational Clearcase (and DSEE before)
% - Microsoft Visual Sourcesafe
% - Sun TeamWare (distributed VCS on top of SCCS), atomic updates
% - BitKeeper (main inspiration for git), followed TeamWare
%history:
% - SCCS http://sccs.sourceforge.net
%   and modern version CSSC https://www.gnu.org/software/cssc/
%other:
% - Subversion (630 000 LOC, hmm)
% - PRCS http://prcs.sourceforge.net/ P for project, better than RCS and
%   CVS for grouping. Kinda snapshot based
%other DVCSs:
% - Darcs 80 000 LOC (using literate haskell), maybe good candidate, simpler
%   model, arguably simpler than git (rebase for free?), some patch theory.
%   But code looks actually awful. Lots of boilerplate. Huge types.
% - GNU Arch (aka tla 273 000 LOC) described as very complicated by many
%   but seems like one of the first DVCS
% - Bazaar (477 000 LOC) and bazaar-NG in Python
%   https://www.jelmer.uk/pages/bzr-a-retrospective.html
% - Monotone (99 000 LOC for 1.1), apparently good source of inspiration
%   for Git because introduced the DAG of SHA1; focused a lot on security
%   13 000 LOC for 0.4
% - Codeville, by Bram Cohen of Bittorrent fame
% - Pijul, initially in OCaml (3000 LOC), then in Rust, but seems to have 
%   a slow development
% - Fossil??
%git alternate porcelain:
% - Gitless, a better design for git, great paper:
%   http://people.csail.mit.edu/sperezde/pre-print-oopsla16.pdf
%   (can implement this design with dulwich?)
%mini:
% - Camp is a simplified version at 6300 LOC
%   a mini Darcs. Simple? Elegant? Arguably more powerful. < 10 000 LOC.
%   Can be good opportunity also to read some haskell code. Maybe can then
%   port the code to OCaml.
% - http://benhoyt.com/writings/pygit/ 500 LOC to push to github,
%   with init/add/commit/push/status/diff/, very nice, but simplified
%   so only support toplevel files, no subdirs (so no subtree).
% - http://gitlet.maryrosecook.com/ mini git in Javascript, heavily
%   commented (but LP would be better)
% - gg 7000 LOC, but no locking, no push, and requires external diff.

%   this guy also wrote a book on Git "Git Magic"
% - SRC, by raymond, wrapper around RCS
%   http://www.catb.org/esr/src/
% - Cmt, git inspired, in OCaml, cornell student project
%   https://github.com/loganallen/CmlControl
%clones in other languages (all clones of git actually):
% - dulwich: git written in python (15000 LOC (without tests))
%   which includes some porcelain now (there is also another project
%   called gittle which is porcelain for dulwich).
%   Used by Google for some projects to provide bridge between

\section{Getting started}
\label{sec:getting-started}

To play with [[ocamlgit]], you will first need to install it
by following the instructions at~\urlinstallbis\footnote{
%bootstrap: 
As you follow the document in the Wiki, you will see that
you will need a VCS program ([[git]]) to get the source of another 
VCS program ([[ocamlgit]]).
This is similar to bootstrapping issues in compilers.
However, for VCSs an easy way to avoid those issues is to provide
instead an archive file of the source (e.g., [[ocamlgit-0.1.tar.gz]]).
\n and extra patches 
\l but then need wget or browser and network stack 
}.
Once installed, you can test [[ocamlgit]] under \plan or \unix with
the following commands:

\begin{verbatim}
1 $ cd /tests/
2 $ mkdir hello
3 $ cd hello/
4 $ ocamlgit init
5 Initialized empty Git repository in /tests/hello/.git/
6 $ echo "Hello Git" > hello.txt
7 $ ocamlgit add hello.txt
8 $ ocamlgit commit -m "first commit" --author "pad <todo@todo>"
...
\end{verbatim}
\t implement --author
\n alternative is to have config file, but need explain that
\n no need --comitter here
\l more? 2nd modif with 2nd commit and then go back?
\l  but then need explain checkout, HEAD^, too complex? or use git revert?
\l  but it's a commit, because distributed, so complex again.

The command in Line~4 {initializes} a new {\em repository} by
creating the appropriate {metadata} in the [[/tests/hello/.git/]]
subdirectory.
%
Line~7 then {adds} the new file [[hello.txt]] to the {\em staging area} of Git
(I will explain later in Section~\ref{sec:staging-area} what is 
a staging area).
\l same than index? no index is internal DS for managing stage area
Finally, Line~8 {\em commits} what was staged to the repository and {records}
this commit with the {message} ``first commit'' and the
author ``pad''\footnote{This is my nickname}.
\l and author and date?

\label{sec:git-abbrev}
In the rest of this document, I will often abbreviate 
the command [['ocamlgit']] by using instead the command [['git']].
You can even define [['git']] as an alias for [['ocamlgit']] in your shell.
Indeed, [[ocamlgit]] uses the same command-line interface
than the program [[git]]. 
Almost all [[ocamlgit]] commands are valid [[git]] commands\footnote{
The reverse is not true. [[ocamlgit]] implements only a subset of the
commands supported by [[git]].}.
When the interfaces differ, I will explicitely use [['ocamlgit']].



\section{Requirements}

Because most of this book is made of OCaml source code, 
you will need to know the 
OCaml programming language~\cite{ocaml-ref-manual} to understand it.
%
The code of [[ocamlgit]] uses only the core language of OCaml, and none
of its advanced features 
(e.g., functors, objects, labels, polymorphic variants, GADTs),
thus a knowledge of 
Caml~\cite{caml-leroy}, 
Standard ML~\cite{ml-working-programmer}, or 
any of the dialect of ML (e.g., F\#~\cite{fsharp-book}) 
should be enough to understand this book.


You do not need to know Git, or more generally any VCSs,
to understand this book.

However, if while reading this book you have specific questions
on the interface of Git, I suggest you to consult the man
pages of Git\furl{https://git-scm.com/docs}, 
or any of the books on Git (e.g., \cite{git-book}).

\section{Acknowledgments}

I would like to acknowledge first the author of Dulwich,
Jelmer Vernooij, who wrote in some sense most of this book.
%dup: intro/ocamlgit intro/copyright
Indeed, I used mainly the code of Dulwich to write the code of [[ocamlgit]]. 
Dulwich provided an easier path towards understanding
the concepts and implementation of Git.
\l Also Thomas gazanaire.


I would like also to thank Linus Torvalds, the original author of Git,
for designing this simple but powerful VCS.
%
Many of his design decisions seem obvious
in retrospect but they are not: most VCSs chose different designs
(for the storage, 
file permissions, 
for the way to handle renames,
etc.)
\l snapshot-based > changeset?, SHA1 DAG (but Monotone), GMT time, etc.
which in the end are more complicated
and usually less efficient than in Git.
\l ocamlgit only 6400 LOC (C bigger but original C 1000 LOC), far more powerful 
\l than RCS 30 000, in big part due to simple but clever design of Git





\chapter{Overview}

%trans: %dup: Assembler.nw
Before showing the source code of [[ocamlgit]] in the following chapters, 
%toc: %dup: Assembler.nw
I first give an overview in this chapter of the general principles of a VCS.
I also quickly describe the command-line interface of [[ocamlgit]],
\l (and so of [[git]] too),
the format of a Git repository, and I use a simple terminal session containing
[[ocamlgit]] commands to illustrate its major features.
%dup: Assembler.nw
Finally, I define terms, explain how the code is organized, 
and more generally give the background necessary
to understand the code I will show later.

\section{Version control system principles}

% (\footnote{how Linux done for a long time}, human VCS) :) )
% no git blame. discipline.
%src: SCCS paper
% Code changes all the time. Bugs, experimentatl features, optims.
%  not just current version but last year's (still supported) and next year!
%  maintenance old code. Chaos if no tool, if no discipline.

\l VCS vs SCM?


%toc:
The main requirements for a modern VCS are to be able to
store past versions of a set of files,
\l and retrieve, and actually set of files
to track the changes to those files, 
and to help multiple developers to collaborate with each other 
on those files by supporting
concurrent and parallel development (I will explain soon the differences
between those two kinds of development).
%
The next sections will each give more details about those requirements.
I will also try to present the major techniques used by popular VCSs 
to satisfy those requirements. 
%
Finally, I will discuss two different architectures for VCSs: 
centralized and distributed.

% try be general and add %git: for git instantiation of general principles
\subsection{Storing past versions}

The first requirement of a VCS is to store past versions of a file,
hence the 'V' in VCS. However, there is also an 'S' in VCS, which means
it must be done in a systematic way. 
\l and with user in 'C'ontrol, or in a Controlled way
\t meh
%without:
Indeed, one way to understand the usefulness of a VCS
is to see how people are struggling when they are managing
documents that evolves (e.g., source code, LaTeX files, notes) without
a VCS.
%
In that situation, people often uses [[cp]] to {\em backup} files, but it is
inefficient space-wise and error-prone. 
\l but backup where?
%It is easy to forget to backup.
\l but with VCS you have to remember too to commit



%trans:
% first purpose of VCS is store (and also retrieve) past versions.

% Some fs can do that. in fact plan9 used that! \cite? VMS had versioned FS?
% But dedicated FS. VCS is regular tool, no need special kernel.

% Time filesystem could do that, e.g. cd /2016/01/01/project/.
% Can even be encoded efficiently (deltas backup system, deduplication).
% But need special fs. And VCS provides additional nice services
% like commit message, and git blame!! who, when, why, where!
% (but could have a history.txt file in the project,
% and also symlinks to tag version at specific time).

\subsubsection{The repository}
%\subsubsection{Metadata}

% RCS/, CVS/CVSRoot in each dir, .git/ toplevel (hidden by default with ls)

% Actually def of repo? just .git/? or .git/ + working files?
% so kinda of topdir?
% Can mean whole thing or just metadata depending on context. Fuzzy.

% No fs, no hidden meta-data, 
% so need use filesystem as a db.

% file version database
% metadata (RCS/,v, .git/objects/, CVS/CVSRoot and other dir or server, etc.)
% metadata and data in fact. past versions are really data.

% First, store past versions. Can go back in time if made a mistake.
% Could get that with copy, but need discipline, filename encoding
%  better organized, and storing deltas has efficiency implications. 
%update: actually git does not really use delta. really more a content tracker.
%update: actually can use delta, but for packfile.

% Different storage strategy.
% Some use per-file history [[,v]], flat dirs (.git/objects/), 
% Berkely DB (SVN), Sqlite (monotone), changesets (?)

\subsubsection{Working copy}
% you work on copy from repo (hence name)

% working tree

% checkout, checkin

% So can use any editor to edit!
% (departure from Word/Excel where versions and editing are using same tool)

%rcs: checkout

\subsubsection{Delta}

\subsubsection{Compression}

\subsection{Tracking changes}

%trans: %dup: intro/motivations
% second is track changes. when, where, who, why each change.

% fs could do. But which granularity? let user records
% relevant change points!

%without:
% Changelog file in many programs

\subsubsection{The commit}

%dup: intro/motivations
% who, when, what/where, and why.

% attach note to changeset.
% incredibly useful for git blame! can help find bugs, see related
% code because related changes!

% record who made change, what change, and even why! great resource.
% git blame!

%rcs: checkin

% then commit information.
%git: again use object for that. then easy to reference
% a tree version by referencing a commit id.
% Also then can have references, symbolic references.
% Also have parents! so full history on how you got there.


\subsubsection{Version identifier}

% version, revision.

% need have different versions, different version id.
%git: use simple scheme: not v1, v2, ... but sha1 of content!
% then get for free consistency checking

% release.level
% so one way to organize set of files and have changeset by having
% all developers increment release (but then need modify every file? RCS
% does not accept empty updates)

%sccs: introduced extra lettre for different customer, so 1.2.p

% 1.1, 1.2,
%git:
%  or sha1! identified by its content! file content! but can
%  also scale to set of files! or tree! or commit!
%  has some advantages.
%Also in distributed settings, how can have global identifier?
% each user need tags its version number with its name?
% another thing where sha1 is good, they are stable across machines,
% they are global!

\subsubsection{Change granularity}

% set of logical changes as an individual group (atomic).

%cvs: not atomic?

% then need to have not just version of one file (RCS) but version
% of a tree.
%git: have tree structure which references other blob id and other trees.
% if a full subtree does not change, then share reference.

% single-file history, or whole-tree history.

% - release/level discipline, so update release for all files at certain
%   point
% - use date
% - use tag

% or simply use commit id in modern VCSs :)


\subsubsection{[[diff]]}

% cite paper

% Source code is text!

% sometimes people use commit and diff and patch interchangebly.

% diff can be used especially internally in VCS to efficiently store deltas.
%git: used in pack only
% It got used after as a way to display changes? (and later for coccinelle!)

% Also by having delta
% and message associated with it help explore history. Git log, git
% blame are fantastic tool, even in single-user mode. To know
% code related to a line, the message of this patch, etc.
% Also in multi-user mode good to know the author, test plan, test
% files, coupled code, etc.
% I used it a lot to understand code at Facebook.

% Usually diff at granularity line-level. So add/delete a line are 
% the primitives
% (since SCCS). Fine granularity for source code.
% Could use char, but too big then.


\subsubsection{[[patch]]}

% diff -u, unified format.

%dual of diff. One create diff on his machine, other can apply patch on his.
% (also some fuzzy apply algorithm).

% first years of Linux was managed just with patches.
% tarballs and patches. linux-mm still use patches (quilt).

% In fact git has some commands to deal with paches contained in email
% or to generate such patches.

\subsection{Concurrent development}

%trans:
% Other role of VCS is help coordinate work of multiple developers.

% When multiple developers, may modify same file, dont want one
% to overwrite change of other. Need control access to shared
% resource, the source file.
% How?

% Then when work in groups, useful to have way to work concurrently,
% to not pass his copy and wait for the "token". Concurrent
% techniques are lock, or better optimistic and later merge.

%\subsubsection{Shared space}
%if collaborate, need shared space (hmm with DVCS no, except central repo
% sometimes)

\subsubsection{Locks}

% Simple.

% NFS symlinks

% but easy to forget to unlock, and really annoying for other.
% RCS.

% Locks make sense only with centralized model.

\subsubsection{Merging}
% optimistic merging?

% surprisingly, it works!
% CVS.
% Pseudo-simultaneously

% 3 way merge.
% cite paper?

% but need update first. 
%facebook: What if time update and time commit long
% so always another guy in the middle.

% Actually CVS did not have atomic commit of multiple files at the
% same time. Files were still treated separately.

\subsubsection{Merge conflicts}

% show conflict with <<<< === >>>>

\subsection{Parallel development}

%trans:
% Finally, can help organize development.

% like concurrent, but longer time-scale. Does not expect to merge
% immediately.

\subsubsection{Branch}

% Branches are also very useful. Work on different tasks, different
% branches. Can juggle between those.

% - temp fixes (never merged)
% - parallel devel for experimental feature (may be merged)
% - real fork (may be merged)

% RCS had branches, but per-file! tedious.
% CVS got it, but complicated, because was relying on RCS.
% git far easier! because every different repo/user is a branch! because
%  distributed, so had to get merge right and fast!

% so line, then tree, then DAG.

% Saw merge before, but merge really make sense with branching.
% Useful to branch and merge. 
% Also useful for branch and merge on a peer-to-peer basis
% (networking)

\subsubsection{Merging}

% Same, but usually bigger, and can get complicated?

% Real VCS needs cheap branches and good (heuristics) merging.

%\subsection{Revision graph}
% RCS was a tree, but then when introduce real branches get merges and a DAG!
% head, tip, branch, fork, merge, root, trunk, ... lots of graph words.
%\subsubsection{A mainline} 
%\subsubsection{A tree of branches} 
%\subsubsection{A direct-acyclic graph of merges} 
\subsubsection{A direct acyclic graph of versions}
%Again, ... as in Make.nw.


% really important. linear versions, then tree, then DAG!
% Lots of terminology about graph (HEAD, tip, ...)

% Previous VCS did not record relation between changeset (which
% requires identify changeset), and so merge could also not work good?




%\subsection{Variants}
\subsection{Centralized versus distributed}
\label{sec:distributed-vs-centralized}
% pulling and pushing

% but in both cases pull and push.

% github kinda centralize, but still independent repo! can work offline

% decentralized so no need access permission! Can fork, work,
% commit locally, and then ask for master to merge you.

% What brings distributed then? More convenient than centralized.
% Less imposing. Nice to have everything locally. Just more general.
% Can do centralized with distributed (e.g. "main" repo on github
% is the main thing to pull from).

% When distributed, not centralized, so no need path to shared repo
% or CVSROOT and so no need concepts such as module as in CVS.
% (actually there is concept of submodule and gitlink)
% Have different projects? Use different repo! Simple.

%\subsection{Snapshot versus changeset}
% on changesets vs snapshot-based VCS
%https://web.archive.org/web/20100327150715/sourcefrog.net/weblog/software/vc/derivatives.html
% snapshot fast to go back to previous version. No delta application.
% Just copy blob!
% But blame slower with snapshot. Need explore all history.

%\subsection{Hosting}
%\subsection{Github}
% sourceforge before.
% Finally github is fantastic. Easy to setup and start sharing work.

% Before pain create repo to collaborate. Need server, start and config
% CVS server there, password, etc. Now just create on github and clone!

%\subsection{Git}
% many more concepts: index/HEAD/master/remote/sha1 but git specific



\section{[[git]] command-line interface}

%trans: %dup: Windows.nw
I just described the general principles of a VCS, 
and illustrated some of those principles with examples from RCS, CVS, or Git.
I will now focus exclusively on Git and give more details about
the interface of its command-line program: [[git]].
%dup: intro/getting-started
As I mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:git-abbrev}, the
command-line interface of [[ocamlgit]] is almost identical
to the one of the program [[git]]. This is why I will often use
[[git]] as an alias for [[ocamlgit]] in the rest of this document.

The command-line interface of [[git]] (and [[ocamlgit]]) is pretty simple:
%dup: (but use git not ocamlgit this time) intro/getting-started
\begin{verbatim}
1 $ git
2 usage: git <init|add|rm|commit|branch|checkout|reset|...> [options]
3 $ git init
4 Initialized empty Git repository in /tests/hello/.git/
5 $ git add hello.txt
6 $ git commit -m "first commit" --author "pad <todo@todo>"
\end{verbatim}
% git <cmd> [-options] <extra arguments>

[[git]] takes first a {\em command} as its first argument and then
options and extra arguments specific to this command.
\l git uses also some common options for all its commands (but not ocamlgit)
%
For example, the command 
[[init]] at Line~3 does not need any extra arguments, but
[[add]] at Line~5 requires at least the name of a file or directory, and 
[[commit]] at Line~6 usually requires command-line flags.
%chunks:
I will gradually describe the different [[git]] commands, their
options, and implementations in the following chapters.
%alt:
\l vcs <cmd> simpler than having 10 command-line /bin programs (started by CVS?)

%trans:
To understand how Git is implemented, and 
to some degree to learn how to use Git effectively,
you need to know the few concepts underlying Git.
%toc:
Those concepts are 
%toc:
the {\em object store}, 
\l (SHA1 (double DAG) Merkel Tree?)
the {\em reference}, and 
the {\em staging area}.
%
They correspond also to [[ocamlgit]]'s main data structures,
which I will describe fully in Chapter~\ref{chap:core-ds}.
%toc:
The following sections will just give an overview of those data structures. 

\subsection{Object store}
\label{sec:object-store}

%torvalds:
To really understand Git, you need to realize that at its core,
Git is a simple {\em content-addressable storage system}.
\l stupid content tracker, as said by torvalds in his first commit
\n rsync was first content-based addressing with md5sum?
%
Given the {\em hash} of a content (Git uses SHA1 hashes, as explained below), 
Git can retrieve back quickly the full corresponding content.
%
Git internally is simply a {\em persistent hash table}, also known
as a {\em key/value store}.

\n the value
In this store, Git manipulates mainly three kinds of values, known
as {\em objects} in Git terminology (hence the term {\em object store}):
\begin{itemize}
\item A {\em blob}: to represent the content of a file at
a specific time.
\l version
\l can also be symlinkk content hence use of Blob and not File (also because
\l  specific to a time)

\item A {\em tree}: to assign names to blobs or other subtrees

\item A {\em commit}: to associate to a specific toplevel tree
a message, an author, a date, and zero or more {\em parent} commits
\n also file types

\end{itemize}

You will see another kind of objects in Section~\ref{sec:tags} with the 
{\em tag}.
%
In addition to those objects, Git maintains also {\em references}
to specific commits and an {\em index} of specific blobs, as explained 
in the next sections.

%\subsubsection{SHA1 objects DAG}

\label{sec:git-sha1-intro}
\n the key
Regarding the keys of the store, Git uses the 
SHA1 algorithm~\cite{sha1,rfc3174}
to compute the hash of an object.
This algorithm associates an almost unique number of 160 bits
(which amounts to 20 bytes, or 40 digits in hexadecimal format) to 
any content of arbitrary length.
\l message digest (MD as in MD5), actually message must be < 2^64
Section~\ref{sec:sha1-algo} presents the code of this algorithm
and gives more information on SHA1.
%
For example, given the content [[Hello Git\n]], the SHA1 algorithm will return
the number [[9f4d96d5b00d98959ea9960f069585ce42b1349a]]
in hexadecimal format.
%
Here the hashing is not very interesting because the hash is bigger
than the original content, but in practice most files under a VCS
are far bigger than 20 bytes.



SHA1 is a complex {cryptographic hash function}. It is outside
the scope of this book to explain how and why it works, but
what is important for Git is that SHA1 is an almost perfect hash function:
\l gperf?
given two different content, there is an almost zero probability
that SHA1 will return the same hash number. 
Such an event is called a {\em collision}, and in practice it
should never happen.
%
Thanks to this almost perfect hash function, Git can {identify}
any content of any length with just a 20 bytes number.
%
In Git, the SHA1 of a file is similar to the {\em inode} of
a file in a filesystem (see the \book{Kernel} for more information
on filesystems and inodes)\footnote{
%torvalds:
The author of Git, Linus Torvalds, is also the author of Linux,
which explains why he chose a design inspired by filesystems.
},
except it references a specific version of a file.
%
In the tree object, which associates names to blobs, Git
uses the SHA1 of a blob to identify this blob. In the same way,
in the commit object, Git uses the SHA1 of a tree to identify
the toplevel tree a commit refers to.



Figure~\ref{fig:objects-sha1-dag} presents the Git objects
(and their relationships) of the Git repository created 
in Section~\ref{sec:getting-started} after the addition of another commit.
%
The first commit, which added [[hello.txt]], is at the top left of 
Figure~\ref{fig:objects-sha1-dag}.
The second commit, below, added the two files [[foo.txt]] and [[bar.txt]]
under a directory [[dir1/]], and also modified [[hello.txt]].
%
I will describe soon in Section~\ref{sec:repository-format} 
how Git stores those objects on the disk.
\t Same file, 2 blobs. Versioned. Sometimes 2 files, same blob. Dedup.
\t But each version store entirely. Seems naive compared to RCS deltas.
\t But gzip, and later will see pack to optimize.

\l so back to content-addressable storage, given hash xxx
\l  Git can retrieve quickly blob content.

\l similar to FS. Tree, files. But differences.
\l First DAG! blob can have multiple parents
\l  (also when add in index, some blob get multiple parents)
\l tree can refer same blob, same subtree. DAG.
\l   Like versioned FS.

\l SHA1 used for many things for Git (said later?)
\l SHA1 dedup (said later)
%torvalds:
\l SHA1 checking .not just for identify, also for checking. signature
\l   Make sure what get back what was put. Essential for VCS for torvalds
\l SHA1 to index key/value

\l git does not track changes, it track states! so very different approach
% which in the end I think simplify many things.
% snapshot-based (so fast, at potentially cost of disk space, always
% tradeoff). No delta app.

\l Stored as diffs? apparently not. Just compressed and indexed by sha.
% If same content, then same id.
% No delta (well more on this later with packing).


%\subsubsection{SHA1 Commit DAG}

Commit objects are linked together, 
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:objects-sha1-dag}
with the second commit linked to the first commit
through the [[parents]] field of the object.
%
Those links represent the history of the repository, also known
as its {\em log}.
%
A commit can have multiple parents
in the case of a {\em merge} 
(I will explain in Section~\ref{sec:git-merge} how to merge branches in Git).
Thus, the log forms a {\em graph}, or more specifically 
a {\em direct acyclic graph} (DAG).
%
Figure~\ref{fig:commit-dag} shows such a graph for an additional series of
commits following the first two commits of Figure~\ref{fig:objects-sha1-dag}.
%
In this example, a developer {\em forked} first 
an experimental branch called [[branch1]] 
(I will explain briefly how to create a branch in
Section~\ref{sec:create-branch-tutorial}
and fully in Section~\ref{sec:create-branch})
following the second commit of Figure~\ref{fig:objects-sha1-dag}. 
%
At the same time, development on the main branch, called the 
{\em master branch} in Git terminology, continued and saw two commits:
[[commit4]] and [[commit6]].
%
The experimental branch got {\em merged} later at [[commit7]]
(I will explain in Section~\ref{sec:git-merge} how to merge branches in Git).
This is why this commit has two parents.
%
Later on, a developer created another branch called [[experiment]] that
remained {active} and did not get merged yet; 
it follows in parallel the development of the {master branch}.

\subsection{References}
\label{sec:references}
\l and the commit graph

%trans: %dup: overview/hello.git/concepts/content-addressable
As I mentionned briefly in the previous section, 
Git maintains, in addition to the object store, {\em references} to
specific commit objects. 
%
Those references have a {\em name} and a {\em content}.
%
For example, in Figure~\ref{fig:commit-dag}, the reference named
[[refs/heads/experiment]]
points to the last commit of the [[experiment]] branch, and
its content is the SHA1 of the [[commit9]] object.
%
I will explain in Section~\ref{sec:repository-format} how
Git stores those references on the disk.

\label{sec:HEAD}
Git maintains also a {special reference} called the {\em HEAD}
which points to the last commit of the {\em current branch}
(see the bottom of Figure~\ref{fig:commit-dag}).
\n actually points to another head
Its content is usually not a SHA1 but the name of another reference.
%
By default, [[HEAD]] points to the master branch, as shown at the bottom of
Figure~\ref{fig:commit-dag}, and so its content is
the string [[ref: refs/heads/master]]
(and [[refs/heads/master]] contains the SHA1 of the last 
commit of the master branch).
%
When you switch branch
(I will explain how to switch branch briefly in 
Section~\ref{sec:switch-branch-tutorial} and fully in 
Section~\ref{sec:switch-branch}),
the content of the [[HEAD]] will change.


A reference pointing to the last commit of a branch
is called a {\em head} in Git terminology and starts with [[refs/heads/]].
In Figure~\ref{fig:commit-dag}, those heads are [[refs/heads/experiment]]
and [[refs/heads/master]].

Git maintains a final set of special references called
the {\em remotes}, for example [[refs/remotes/origin/master]]
pointing to [[commit8]]
in Figure~\ref{fig:commit-dag}. Those references are used 
when people are collaborating with each other and I will explain them
in Chapter~\ref{chap:exchanging}.
\l commit at last synchro and so local commits diverging from remote

% really object store and then .git/refs/ and using sha1 can encode
% many idioms (branches, origin for push/pull, tags, stash)

\subsection{Staging area}
\label{sec:staging-area}

%trans:
The last important concept of Git is the {\em staging area}.
\l which is a concept specfic to Git.
%
Git operates mainly on three different areas, as shown at
the top of Figure~\ref{fig:git-areas}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The {\em working copy} contains the current state of the files

\item The {\em repository} contains all past versions of all the files 
including the state of the files at the last commit

\item The {\em staging area} contains what the user wants to commit
next
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[!]\centering
\begin{verbatim}

Repository          Staging               working
  (HEAD)              area                  copy
             |                     |
 hello.txt   |                     |     hello.txt

             |   (marked for       |
             |   deletion)         |    other.txt
             |                     |    (untracked)
             |                     |
\end{verbatim}
\caption{Git areas.}\label{fig:git-areas}
\end{figure}
\l put remote1 and remote2 too?

After you {modify} a set of files in your working copy,
for example, [[bar.txt]], [[foo.txt]], and [[misc.txt]]
at the right of Figure~\ref{fig:git-areas}, you need to
indicate which of those files and modifications should be part
of the next commit.
%
To do so, you need to {\em mark} those files by using the command
[[git add]] (or [[git rm]] if you want to mark for deletion a file).
%
%After you created a new repository, you must also use [[git add]] to add a 
%new file to the repository.
%In that case the file is said to be {\em tracked} in Git terminology.
%
%Then, you must use [[git add]] when you modify a tracked file
%to mark it for the next commit.


Once you marked all the relevant files, you can use the command [[git commit]]
to commit the modifications to the repository.
\l also git add --patch for interactively adding hunks (used by magit?)
For example, in Figure~\ref{fig:git-areas}, only the modifications
to [[foo.txt]] and the deletion of [[misc.txt]] will be part
of the next commit, and not the modifications to [[bar.txt]].

Once you add a file in a repository, the file is said to be
{\em tracked} in Git terminology.
%
You can sometimes avoid manipulating explicitely the staging area 
by using instead the command [[git commit -a]] to automatically commit all
the modifications to the tracked files.
%
However, the staging area and [[git add]] give more flexibility
to the user by allowing to split a set of modifications in multiple
commits. For example, in Figure~\ref{fig:git-areas}, the modification
to [[bar.txt]] can be put in another commit.
%gitless: useless area

% git status, modified, staged, or untracked.

Internally, Git uses a data structure called the {\em index}
(also known as the {\em directory cache})
to manage the staging area.
%
I will explain later in Section~\ref{sec:index} why
this data structure is called an index.



\section{Repository format: [[.git/]]}
\label{sec:repository-format}

%trans: 
Now that you know the main concepts and data structures underlying Git, 
it will be easy to understand the format of the [[.git/]] directory.
%
Here is the sligtly edited output of the \unix command [[tree]],
which recursively explores a directory and displays its content as a tree
\footnote{See \url{http://mama.indstate.edu/users/ice/tree/}
for more information about the [[tree]] program. The [[-F]] option
used in the terminal session above is to add the special mark [['/']]
at the end of directory names, to help differentiate regular files from
subdirectories.
}.
\n actually now also in utilities/misc/tree.ml
The command is applied here to the [[/tests/hello/.git/]] directory after the 
last command in Section~\ref{sec:getting-started},
when the repository contained just one commit:

\begin{verbatim}
1 $ pwd
/tests/hello
2 $ tree -F .git/
.git/
|-- HEAD
...
|-- index
|-- objects/
|   |-- 2f/

    |-- heads/
    |   `-- master

\end{verbatim}

%    `-- tags/

\l encoding UTF8 for filenames.
% https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/i18n.txt

The objects of the key/value store are simply stored in separate
files under [[.git/objects/]]. The hexadecimal digits of the
SHA1 of the object are split in two parts: 
the first two digits are used for the directory name containing the object and 
the remaining digits for the filename of the object.
%
For example, the file
[[.git/objects/9f/4d96d5b00d98959ea9960f069585ce42b1349a]] contains
the blob of [[Hello Git\n]] (see the blob
and its SHA1 at the top right of Figure~\ref{fig:objects-sha1-dag}).

Git uses the first two digits of the SHA1 to classify objects
in separate folders to avoid having too many files in the same
directory. Indeed, this would slow down filesystem operations
such as opening a file referenced by a specific SHA1 key,
a recurring operation under Git
(see the \book{Kernel} for more information on the performance
of filesystem operations).

The references are also stored simply in separate files.
Git uses the name of the reference as the path to a file
under [[.git/refs/]] (e.g., [[.git/refs/heads/master]] in the
example above).

Finally, the index and the HEAD are stored directly under [[.git/]]
in separate files.


\section{[[hello/.git/]]}
\label{sec:git-tutorial}
%\subsection{A terminal session using [[git]]}

%trans: ?
\t some trans?
%toc:
In this section, I will give a short tutorial on how to use Git. 
I will explain the main commands of [[git]] by using a terminal session
starting from an empty [[hello/]] directory.
%trans:
I will continue the series of commands I introduced 
in Section~\ref{sec:getting-started}.
%
I will also describe the semantics of those commands by showing
their effects on the Git metadata stored under the [[hello/.git/]] subdirectory
(by using mainly the output of the [[tree]] command,
as in the previous section).
%
This will hopefully help you to understand the code of
those commands I will present later in the following chapters.
%trans: %toc:
%However, before showing this terminal session, I need to present the main
%concepts behind Git, some Git-specific terminology, and
%the format of the [[.git/]] repository.


%trans:
%I can finally present the tutorial on how to use a few of the main commands
%of Git. I can now describe the precise semantics of those commands.
%
%I will start from the same commands than in Section~\ref{sec:getting-started},
%but I will also explain this time how those commands modify
%files under [[.git/]] (by using mainly the output of the [[tree]] command,
%as in the previous section).
%inspiration:
% - http://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/
% - git from the bottom up (great, I read it while at FB)

\l Here just quick session, quick tutorial.See book to learn how to use git
%dup: use git below, but really ocamlgit, try compatible UI.

\subsection{Creating a repository}
\label{sec:git-tutorial-init}

Here are the commands to create a fresh new repository:

%dup: (but uses git not ocamlgit and add tree command) intro/getting-started
\begin{verbatim}
1 $ cd /tests/
2 $ mkdir hello
3 $ cd hello/
4 $ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /tests/hello/.git/
5 $ tree -F .git/
.git/
|-- HEAD
...
|-- objects/
`-- refs/
    |-- heads/
6 $ cat .git/HEAD
ref: refs/heads/master
\end{verbatim}
%|-- branches/
%|-- config
%|-- description
%|-- hooks/
% ...
%|-- info/
%|   `-- exclude
%...
%|   |-- info/
%|   `-- pack/
%...
%    `-- tags/

The [[init]] command creates just the directory structure
under [[.git/]], without any objects or references in it
(the [[.git/objects/]] and [[.git/refs/heads]] are empty directories above).
%
There is also not yet an index file.
%
There is a [[HEAD]] file, but its contents,
shown with command~6 above 
references an head that does not exist yet under [[.git/refs/heads/]].

\subsection{Staging a diff}

Here is the command to add a new file (or a new version
of a file) to the repository:

\begin{verbatim}
1 $ echo "Hello Git" > hello.txt
2 $ git add hello.txt
3 $ tree -F .git/
.git/
|-- HEAD
...
|-- index
...
|-- objects/
|   |-- 9f/
|   |   `-- 4d96d5b00d98959ea9960f069585ce42b1349a
...
`-- refs/
    |-- heads/
4 $ cat .git/objects/9f/4d96d5b00d98959ea9960f069585ce42b1349a 
x^K\312\311OR04`\360H\315\311\311Wp\317,\341^B^@4\201^Ec
\end{verbatim}
\l git rm


Adding the first file in a repository has two effects:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The creation of a new {blob object} 
(here in [[.git/objects/9f/4d96...]])
containing essentially the compressed form of the content of the added file
(hence the cryptic output of the [[cat]] command above).
I will fully explain in Chapter~\ref{chap:reading} the format
of a blob on the disk.
\n can now understand compression/decompression in code orga tabular
\l dedup discuss here? and git does not track changes but state?

\item The creation of the index file. Again, I will describe
precisely the format of the index file in Chapter~\ref{chap:reading},
but the index essentially associates to every tracked filenames by
the repository
the SHA1 of the blob {\em currently} corresponding to the filename. 
%
In the example above, the index will associate to the filename [[hello.txt]]
the SHA1 [[9f4d96...]].

\end{enumerate}

%dup: ?
You must use the command [[add]] to add a new file
to the repository, when the file was not yet {tracked} by
the repository. However, you must also use the command [[add]]
to stage the modifications on a tracked file as in 
Figure~\ref{fig:git-areas}.
\l really new version of a file
%dup: above
%
In that case, the [[add]] command also creates a new blob with the
current content of the file. It also updates the index so the filename
of the added file now points to the SHA1 of the new blob.


Note that using [[git add]] on an unmodified file will have no effect. Indeed,
Git will compute the SHA1 of the current content, which will be
identical to the SHA1 of an existing blob. Updating the index will have also
no effect because the filename will reference the same SHA1.
\l or look at date to optimize? 
\l immutable object store beauty (said later?)
\l FIGURE?

\subsection{Committing a diff}

Here is the command to commit to the repository what was previously
staged:

\begin{verbatim}
1 $ git commit -m "first commit" --author "pad <todo@todo>"
2 $ tree -F .git/
.git/
|-- HEAD
|-- index
|-- objects/
|   |-- 2f/
|   |   `-- 092e9cadfc1eb4a6d2febfddb941f4c1fe6fd6
|   |-- 19/
|   |   `-- d977a48d1d7b7ae8d520dd66190702dd4fb5bc
|   |-- 9f/
|   |   `-- 4d96d5b00d98959ea9960f069585ce42b1349a
`-- refs/
    |-- heads/
    |   `-- master
3 $ cat .git/refs/heads/master
19d977a48d1d7b7ae8d520dd66190702dd4fb5bc
\end{verbatim}
\t normally gives more output when commit something [master (root-commit)...]

The [[commit]] command has three effects:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The creation of a new {tree object}, in the example above
[[.git/objects/2f/092e...]]
(see Figure~\ref{fig:objects-sha1-dag} for the content of this tree).
This tree derives from the content of the index. Because the repository
contains only one directory (the toplevel root containing just [[hello.txt]]), 
[[git commit]] will create just one tree object, but in general when
a project has many directories [[git commit]] may create many new tree objects.
\t share! dedup!

\item The creation of a new {commit object}, here
[[.git/objects/19/d977...]],
referencing the newly created tree object
(again, see Figure~\ref{fig:objects-sha1-dag} for the content of this commit
and its relationship to the tree object).

\item The update of the content of the head of the current branch
([[refs/heads/master]] according to the content of [[.git/HEAD]])
to contain the SHA1 of the newly created commit object
(here [[19d977...]]), as shown by command~3 above.
\l note that first commit, so create first time refs/heads/master file
\end{enumerate}

Note that it can be tedious to specify each time on the command-line
your name and email through the [[--author]] flag of [[git commit]].
Git can also leverage a configuration file containing such
information in a [[.gitconfig]] file in your home directory
as explained in Section~\ref{sec:gitconfig}.

\l \subsection{New version of a file}

\subsection{Managing branches}
\label{sec:create-branch-tutorial}

%trans:
% covered all commands in Section X.
%Together, the [[init]], [[add]], and [[commit]] commands can cover
%most of the use case of a developer using Git by himself.
%Now powerful command for parallel development.
%As explained in Section X, To experiment with new features, 
% as in Figure~\ref{fig:commit-dag}.

Here is the command to create a new branch:

\begin{verbatim}
1 $ git branch experiment
2 $ tree -F .git/
.git/
|-- HEAD
...
`-- refs/
    |-- heads/
    |   |-- experiment
    |   `-- master
...
3 $ cat .git/HEAD 
ref: refs/heads/master
4 $ cat .git/refs/heads/master
19d977a48d1d7b7ae8d520dd66190702dd4fb5bc
5 $ cat .git/refs/heads/experiment
19d977a48d1d7b7ae8d520dd66190702dd4fb5bc
\end{verbatim}

As you can see, creating a new branch is an extremely cheap operation
under Git.
%
It consists just in adding a file under [[.git/refs/heads/]]
with the name of the new branch (here [[.git/refs/heads/experiment]]),
and the SHA1 commit of the current branch
for its content (here [[19d977...]]).
%
However, creating a branch does not switch to this branch as shown
by command~3 above.

\label{sec:switch-branch-tutorial}
Here is the command to switch to the new branch:

\begin{verbatim}
6 $ git checkout experiment
Switched to branch 'experiment'
7 $ cat .git/HEAD
ref: refs/heads/experiment
\end{verbatim}

Switching to a branch is usually a more costly operation.
%
[[git checkout]] modifies [[HEAD]] (as shown by command~7 above), 
which is fast, 
but it also recomputes the index from the tree
object that is referenced in the commit of the head of the new branch,
as well as from all its subtrees
(see Section~\ref{sec:index-from-tree} for the full description 
of this operation).
%
It also updates all the files so that they contain the content of
the blobs referenced in the index.
%
The more the new branch differs from the current branch, the more
costly switching to this new branch will be.

\subsection{Inspecting objects}
\label{sec:git-show-examples}

Git provides a few commands to query the repository.
Those commands are useful to understand the internal structures of Git.
They are also useful for doing some archeology on the history of a project,
as explained in Section~\ref{sec:archeology}.
%
The first of those commands, [[show]], shows the content of a Git object.
[[git show]] takes the SHA1 of an object as a parameter (in hexadecimal format)
\l or objectish ref?
and pretty prints its content in a readable format.
%
Here are a few examples of this command:

\begin{verbatim}
1 $ tree -F .git/
...
|-- objects/
|   |-- 2f/
|   |   `-- 092e9cadfc1eb4a6d2febfddb941f4c1fe6fd6
|   |-- 19/
|   |   `-- d977a48d1d7b7ae8d520dd66190702dd4fb5bc
|   |-- 9f/
|   |   `-- 4d96d5b00d98959ea9960f069585ce42b1349a
...
2 $ git show 9f4d96d5b00d98959ea9960f069585ce42b1349a
Hello Git
3 $ git show 2f092e9cadfc1eb4a6d2febfddb941f4c1fe6fd6
tree 2f092e9cadfc1eb4a6d2febfddb941f4c1fe6fd6

hello.txt
4 $ git show 19d977a48d1d7b7ae8d520dd66190702dd4fb5bc
commit 19d977a48d1d7b7ae8d520dd66190702dd4fb5bc
Author: pad  <todo@todo>
Date:   Fri Sep 29 14:04:46 2017 -0700

    first commit

diff --git a/hello.txt b/hello.txt
new file mode 100644
index 0000000..9f4d96d
--- /dev/null
+++ b/hello.txt
@@ -0,0 +1 @@
+Hello Git
\end{verbatim}
\t need fix ocamlgit to output that diff format
\l talk about diff?
\l would be nice to have tree SHA1 reference from commit and also
\l SHA1 reference of blobs in the tree.

The command [[show]] mainly opens the appropriate file under [[.git/objects/]],
decompresses the file, and finally displays its content.

Another important query command is [[log]] to see the full history
of a repository. Here is the output of this command on the
repository we used this far:

\begin{verbatim}
1 $ git log
commit 19d977a48d1d7b7ae8d520dd66190702dd4fb5bc
Author: pad  <todo@todo>
Date:   Fri Sep 29 14:04:46 2017 -0700

    first commit
\end{verbatim}

The command [[log]] mainly opens [[.git/HEAD]] to get a reference
to the last commit. Then, it goes through the parent links of the
commit object to recursively explore all the linked commit 
objects (stored again under [[.git/objects/]]).

\subsection{Other commands}

%trans:
%Together, the [[init]], [[add]], [[commit]], [[branch]], [[checkout]]
% commands can cover
%most of the use case of a developer using Git by himself.

%chunks:
There are a few other important Git commands: 
[[git merge]], 
[[git status]], 
[[git diff]],
[[git clone]], 
[[git pull]], or 
[[git push]], 
but I will introduce them later in this document.

\section{Software architecture}
\label{sec:archi}

Figure~\ref{fig:controlflow} describes the main {modules}
of [[ocamlgit]] and their main dependencies.
\n hidden client/pull/push stuff and reduced deps 
Those dependencies correspond roughly also to the main control 
flow of [[ocamlgit]].
%
This flow starts at the top of Figure~\ref{fig:controlflow} with the 
execution of [<Main.main()>] when the program [[ocamlgit]] starts. 
%
This function looks whether the first argument of [[ocamlgit]] is one
of the command listed in the global [<Cmds.main_commands>].
%
If it is, then [<Main.main()>] dispatches the appropriate
command, for example, [<Cmd_add.cmd>] if the first argument
to [[ocamlgit]] was [[add]].
%
Each command usually processes the remaining command-line arguments
to [[ocamlgit]] and uses functions from the API provided by
the [[Repository]] module. This API contains functions to
open a repository ([<Repository.open_()>]),
read an object ([<Repository.read_obj()>]),
add an object ([<Repository.add_obj()>]),
modify a reference ([<Repository.set_ref()>]),
modify the index ([<Repository.add_in_index()>]),
etc.
%
Internally, the [[Repository]] module relies on the
[[Objects]], [[Refs]], and [[Index]] modules to read and write
files under the [[.git/]] directory 
(e.g., [<Index.read()>] and [<Index.write()>] to respectively read and
write the index file in [[.git/index]]).
\l explain Blob/Tree/Commit ?
%
Those modules in turn rely on algorithms 
to compute SHA1 hashes ([<Sha1.sha1()>]),
to list the differences between two files ([<Diffs.diff()>]),
to merge two files coming from a common base file ([<Diff3.diff3()>]),
or to compress ([<Zip.deflate()>]) 
and decompress ([<Unzip.inflate()>]) data.
\l explain pull/push and clients? not enough space? too complicated for now?
\l say that in rest of doc will use SHA1 to mean SHA1 hash (shorter)

\section{Book structure}

%trans: %dup: (and adapted) from Assembler.nw
You now have enough background to understand the source code of [[ocamlgit]].
%toc: 
The rest of the book is organized as follows.
%dup: (repeat a bit) intro/code-orga
I will start by describing the core data structures of [[ocamlgit]]
in Chapter~\ref{chap:core-ds}.
Chapter~\ref{chap:reading} and Chapter~\ref{chap:writing} 
contains respectively the code to read and write those
data structures on the disk in files under [[.git/]].
%
Then, I will switch to a top-down approach, starting with 
Chapter~\ref{chap:main} with the description of [<Main.main()>] 
and the dispatch of the Git commands.
%
In Chapter~\ref{chap:creating} I will describe the code for the [[init]]
command, which initializes the [[.git/]] directory.
%
The following five chapters will describe the commands of [[ocamlgit]]
%dup:? ?
that cover most of the use-cases for a single developer:
%which rely on the code of the previous chapters to manipulate the files
%under [[.git/]]:
Chapter~\ref{chap:staging} will present the code to add files in
the staging area,
Chapter~\ref{chap:committing} the code to commit what was staged, 
Chapter~\ref{chap:branching} the code to create and switch branches,
Chapter~\ref{chap:merging} the code to merge branches, and finally
Chapter~\ref{chap:inspecting} the code to query the repository.
\l inspect Git objects.
%
Chapter~\ref{chap:packing} presents the code to pack and compress objects,
which is an important optimization.
%
Then I will present the commands for collaborating with other developers:
Chapter~\ref{chap:exchanging} presents the code to exchange commits between
repositories, and
Chapter~\ref{chap:networking} the code to exchange those commits through
the network.
%trans:
The code in the previous chapters rely on general algorithms that are useful
not only for Git but also for other programs.
\l ex of other programs?
I will present the code of those general algorithms in
Chapter~\ref{chap:algorithms} (e.g., 
the algorithm to compute the SHA1 of any string, or
the algorithm to compute the differences between two files).
%
Then, I will present advanced functionalities of Git 
that I did not present before to simplify the explanations.
Starting with Chapter~\ref{chap:advanced-features}, I will presents advanced 
features, for instance, the [[.gitconfig]] configuration file.
In Chapter~\ref{chap:advanced-commands} I will present advanced commands,
for instance, [[git tags]].
%for example commands that are useful for developers to develop 
%and debug programs (e.g., [[git bisect]]) when the  source code of 
%those programs is managed by Git, 
% to help develop! not just store/retrieve
Finally in Chapter~\ref{chap:advanced-networking} I will present advanced 
networking options,
for instance, a Git client and Git server using the [[http://]] protocol.
%
Chapter~\ref{chap:conclusion} concludes
and gives pointers to other books in the \principia series.
\l really what the conclusion does? no much pointers I think

Some appendices present the code of non-functional properties:
code to help debug [[ocamlgit]] itself 
in Appendix~\ref{chap:debugging-ocamlgit}.
%Chapter~\ref{chap:profiling-ocamlgit}
%Chapter~\ref{chap:error}
%
Finally, Appendix~\ref{chap:utilities} contains the code of generic utility
functions used by [[ocamlgit]] but which are not specific to [[ocamlgit]].

\chapter{Core Data Structures}
\label{chap:core-ds}

\begin{verse}
\begin{flushright}
  {\it Show me your code and conceal your data structures, and I shall
    continue to be mystified. Show me your data structures, and I
    won't usually need your code; it'll be obvious.\\

\end{flushright}
\end{verse}

%dup: overview/hello.git/git-concepts
I mentioned before in Section~\ref{sec:git-concepts-and-ds} the 
core data structures of Git:
the object store,
the reference, and
the index.
%toc:
This chapter contains three sections introducing the types of
those three data structures.
%
Those data structures contain SHA1 hashes, so I will present first
the types of the different kinds of SHA1 hashes (binary and hexadecimal).
%
%Finally, I will present types for advanced features of Git: 
%the {pack file}, to pack and compress multiple Git ojbects together, and
%the client/server architecture for exchanging Git objects and pack files 
%through the network.

\section{Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA1) hashes}
\n Secure, not Simple.

Git relies heavily on SHA1 hashes to name and address Git objects.
%toc
Git uses two different formats for those hashes: 
binary hashes (mainly for storage on the disk) and
hexadecimal hashes (mainly to interact with the user)
as explained in the following sections.

\t used for many things
%  - identifying (and versioning), 
%  - consistency checking, 
%  - indexing (and also for folders), 
%  - deduplicating (good for rename detection too)
% SHA1 underlies lots of things in git.

%sccs: used checksum (as opposed to RCS) to detect corrupted history files

\subsection{Binary hashes}

%dup: overview/hello.git/concept/object-store
As I mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:git-sha1-intro}, an SHA1 hash
is a 160 bits number. Such a number can be encoded as a sequence of 20 bytes.

<<type [[Sha1.t]]>>=
(* a 20 bytes number (really a string of length 20) *)
type t = string
@

The [[sha1()]] function returns a 20 bytes number for any content
of arbitrary length.

<<signature [[Sha1.sha1]]>>=
(* computes SHA1 of a series of bytes *) 
val sha1: string -> t
@
\n bytes to bytes in the end

I will present the code of [<Sha1.sha1()>] later in
Section~\ref{sec:sha1-algo}.

OCaml types are not powerful enough to express that a binary
SHA1 hash is a sequence of precisely 20 bytes\footnote{
We could use a tuple with 20 character elements, but that would be
tedious to use.}.
The function below expresses this additional constraint:

<<signature [[Sha1.is_sha]]>>=
val is_sha: t -> bool
@
<<function [[Sha1.is_sha]]>>=
let is_sha (x : t) : bool =
  String.length x = 20
@
\n extra checks? forbidden bytes? I dont think so.

This function will be used mostly as a form of
defensive programming in asserts.


\subsection{Hexadecimal hashes}

A 160 bits number can also be represented as 40 characters
in hexadecimal (two hexadecimal characters per byte,
e.g., [["ff"]] for 255).
\l (each byte is actually encoding only 16 values, an hexadecimal number)

<<type [[Hexsha.t]]>>=
(* a 40 characters string, e.g. "d670460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4" *)
type t = string
@

\t SHA1 used in git to identify things version ID (e.g., commit).
% But some commands expect version id. 
%rcs:
% With RCS easy to say retrieve version 1.1, but with git
% not easy to enter binary data i  terminal. 
% Enter Hexsha, ASCII Hexadecimal,  can be input
%dup:
% As I said, easier format for user to enter or read sha in terminal.


Again, OCaml types are not powerful enough to fully express
the format of an hexadecimal SHA1 hash, 
so the function below expresses the remaining constraints:

<<signature [[Hexsha.is_hexsha]]>>=
val is_hexsha: t -> bool
@
<<function [[Hexsha.is_hexsha]]>>=
let is_hexsha x =
 String.length x = 40 && x =~ "^[0-9a-fA-F]+$"
@
%$

\subsection{Conversion functions}

Both formats of SHA1 hashes are useful and we will need many times
to convert from one format to the other.
%
The first conversion function transforms an hexadecimal hash into a
binary hash.

% git use mostly internally binsha, less space, so need convert user
% Hexsha to bin sha1
\l actually commit object contains hexsha, same for references

<<signature [[Hexsha.to_sha]]>>=
val to_sha: t -> Sha1.t
@
<<function [[Hexsha.to_sha]]>>=
let to_sha s =
  assert (is_hexsha s);
  let n = String.length s in
  let buf = Bytes.create (n/2) in
  <<[[Hexsha.to_sha()]] fill [[buf]]>>
  Bytes.to_string buf
@
\t useful for?

%old: 
% let to_sha s =
%  assert (is_hexsha x);
%  to_string x
%let to_string ((*`Hex*) s) =
%  if s = "" 
%  then ""
%  else
%   ...
%let to_string hex =
%  to_helper ~empty_return:"" ~create:Bytes.create ~set:Bytes.set hex
%@

The function [[to_sha()]] relies on the nested function below to iterate over
all the pairs of characters in the hexadecimal hash and
to generate one byte from each pair:

<<[[Hexsha.to_sha()]] fill [[buf]]>>=
let rec aux i =
  if i >= n 
  then ()
  else begin
    <<[[hexsha.to_sha()]] double sanity check range i>>
    Bytes.set buf (i/2) (to_byte s.[i] s.[i+1]);
    aux (i+2)
  end
in
aux 0;
@
%old: let rec aux i j = ...
\l FIGURE? where pair 2 hex in boxes and then convert and show
\l  i range over boxes?

<<function [[Hexsha.to_char]]>>=
let to_byte hex1 hex2 =
  let code hex = 
    match hex with
    | '0'..'9' -> Char.code hex - Char.code '0'
    | 'A'..'F' -> Char.code hex - (Char.code 'A' + 10)
    | 'a'..'f' -> Char.code hex - (Char.code 'a' + 10)
    | _ -> 
      raise (Invalid_argument 
              (spf "Hex.to_byte: %d is an invalid hexadecimal digit" (Char.code hex)))
  in
  Char.chr (((code hex1) lsl 4) + (code hex2))
@
\t spf
%old:
% let to_char x y =
% Char.code c - 55 (* Char.code 'A' + 10 *)
% (useless partial evaluation opti)
% <<function Hexsha.invalid_arg>>=
% let invalid_arg fmt =
%   Printf.ksprintf (fun str -> raise (Invalid_argument str)) fmt
% @


<<[[hexsha.to_sha()]] double sanity check range i>>=
if i+1 >= n 
then raise (Invalid_argument "hex conversion: invalid hex string");
@
\l useless, double, because already is_hexsha assert so odd length

\t When communicate with user, 
% or when access loose object,
% need opposite conversion:

The other conversion function goes the other way around, from
a binary hash to an hexadecimal hash:

<<signature [[Hexsha.of_sha]]>>=
val of_sha: Sha1.t -> t
@
<<function [[Hexsha.of_sha]]>>=
let of_sha s =
  assert (Sha1.is_sha s);
  let n = String.length s in
  let buf = Bytes.create (n * 2) in
  <<[[Hexsha.of_sha()]] fill [[buf]]>>
  Bytes.to_string buf
@
%pad: use let n, not let len, so more consistent with other function
\l FIGURE? reverse of other one with boxes again?
%old:
%let of_sha x =
%  assert (Sha1.is_sha x);
%  of_string_fast x
%  ...
%    Bytes.unsafe_set buf (i * 2)
%      (String.unsafe_get hexa1 (Char.code (String.unsafe_get s i)));
%    Bytes.unsafe_set buf (succ (i * 2))
%      (String.unsafe_get hexa2 (Char.code (String.unsafe_get s i)));
%  (*pad:`Hex*) buf
%pad: succ? unsafe_get? extra intermediate func? bad.

This time, each byte from [[s]] generates two characters:

<<[[Hexsha.of_sha()]] fill [[buf]]>>=
for i = 0 to n - 1 do
  Bytes.set buf (i * 2) hexa1.[Char.code (s.[i])];
  Bytes.set buf ((i * 2) + 1) hexa2.[Char.code (s.[i])];
done;
@

The loop above relies on two constants containing 256 elements
mapping a byte to one of the two hexadecimal characters:

<<constant [[Hexsha.hexa1]]>>=
and hexa1 =
  "0000000000000000111111111111111122222222222222223333333333333333\
   4444444444444444555555555555555566666666666666667777777777777777\
   88888888888888889999999999999999aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb\
   ccccccccccccccccddddddddddddddddeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeffffffffffffffff"
@
<<constant [[Hexsha.hexa2]]>>=
and hexa2 =
  "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef\
   0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef\
   0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef\
   0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef"
@


\section{[[Repository.t]]}

In the following chapters, many functions will require to know
where is located the repository they need to operate on.
\l current dir? cwd?
Those functions will need to access files under the [[.git/]] subdirectory
or to access the working files of a repository.
%
The type below conveniently packs all the necessary information to locate
files on the disk:

<<type [[Repository.t]]>>=
type t = {
  worktree: Fpath.t;
  dotgit: Fpath.t; (* usually <worktree>/.git *)

  <<[[Repository.t]] index field>>
}
@
%  (* less: on bare repo, this could be None *)
%  (* less: on bare repo this could be the toplevel dir *)
%  (* less: compression level config field? *)
\l use Common.path?
\n dotgit could be called commondir or controldir when have bare repo.
\l Hooks later.
\l info?? useful for grafts and?

% Repository type is main type. Main API functions take
% repo as first parameter.

% Store path worktree, path metadata (dotgit),
% and also index. 3 main areas.


% will see open_() later.

% a repo is really a set of commits,
% and also set of names of commits (branches, tags, HEAD).
% But represented in subtle way in git.
% set of objects, and then refs of this object, where some objects can
% be commit.


%trans:
% dotgit contains objects and refs (see next 2 sections).
%python: [] accessors for repo.object_store and repo.refs
% (and even [] for repo itself for objectish)

% Present main API too? as I said in code orga tabular.

%\subsection{Object store}
\label{sec:object-store-function}

% git really is a content addressable storage engine,
% objects are stored in object store.
% To retrive object given its hash, just need path

Given a repository [[r]] and an hexadecimal SHA1 hash [[hexsha]], 
it is easy to locate a Git object on the disk thanks to the
following function:

% internal functions not exposed in repository.mli
<<function [[Repository.hexsha_to_filename]]>>=
(* for loose objects *)
let hexsha_to_filename (r : t) (hexsha : string) : Fpath.t =
  let dir = String.sub hexsha 0 2 in
  let file = String.sub hexsha 2 (String.length hexsha - 2) in
  r.dotgit / "objects" / dir / file
@
%python: nice syntax for string access like hex[:2] and hex[2:]
\l ex of use?  /hello/.git/...
\t comment about loose objects and packing reference?

%old: was used only in add_obj and simpler to use Filename.dirname
%<<function Repository.hexsha_to_dirname>>=
%let hexsha_to_dirname r hexsha =
%  let dir = String.sub hexsha 0 2 in
%  r.dotgit / "objects" / dir
%@

% Regular files!

% talk about the encoding stuff? should aspectize? confusing?

%python: nice overloading of [] (but bad to abuse it) to access object
% store.

The function above relies on a special operator to concatenate
filenames:

<<constant [[Repository.SlashOperator]]>>=
@


\section{[[Objects.t]]}

%dup: overview/hello.git/git-concepts core-ds
As I explained in Section~\ref{sec:object-store}, 
Git uses internally mainly three kinds of objects, as expressed
by the following type:

<<type [[Objects.t]]>>=
type t = 
  | Blob   of Blob.t
  | Tree   of Tree.t
  | Commit of Commit.t
  <<[[Objects.t]] cases>>
@

%https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects

%toc:
The following sections will detail [<Blob.t>], [<Tree.t>], and [<Commit.t>].
The following chapter will describe the format of those objects
on the disk.
\l and the code on how to read and write

\subsection{[[Blob.t]]}
% =~ file content (but no name, name is in tree)

A blob is simply a sequence of bytes. 

<<type [[Blob.t]]>>=
type t = string
@

In the following data structures, some fields will contain SHA1 hashes
that must refer to a blob. 
%
The type below can be used to express this constraint;
this constraint will not be checked statically, but
using the type provides a useful comment:
\l was typechecked actually in ocamlgit, but with tricks

<<type [[Blob.hash]]>>=
type hash = Sha1.t
@
% Later will want to specify that sha1 corresponds to a blob, so
% use type alias for readability (but not really typechecked)


% But no interleave deltas (SCCS), reverse deltas (RCS).
% Each modif generates new blob! disk is cheap now!
% But dedup!
% deduplicating! empty file! copy of file.
% And will see soon compressed on disk!
% And will see later more optim with pack files and deltas.

\subsection{[[Tree.t]]}
% =~ directories =~ project content.

A tree is an ordered list of {entries} where each entry
associates to a name a Git object through its (binary) SHA1.

%"It doesn't bother trying to store per-file histories;
%it instead stores the history at the tree level. When you perform a
%diff you are comparing two trees, not two files."

<<type [[Tree.t]]>>=
(* todo: entries must be sorted! and each name must be unique *)
type t = entry list
@
\t is_tree (consistent with is_sha, is_hexsha, etc)

<<type [[Tree.entry]]>>=
type entry = {
  (* relative to tree, so does not contain any '/', or '.' or '..' *)
  name: string;
  (* Blob.hash or Tree.hash *)
  id: Sha1.t;

  perm: perm;
}
@
%old: use id instead of node, so more consistent with Index.entry.id
%crossref: Sha1.t (said above indirectly)


<<type [[Tree.hash]]>>=
type hash = Sha1.t
@

Each name refers either to 
a file (a blob), or 
a directory (another tree).
% recursive here! with entry.id referencing another tree!

Git handles only a few file types and permissions for those entries,
as expressed by the type below:

% Name can contain space, utf8, whatever! 
% (seemed to be a pb in many other SCMs)

<<type [[Tree.perm]]>>=
(* similar to Index.mode, but with also a 'Dir' *)
type perm = 
  | Normal
  | Dir
  | Exec
  <<[[Tree.perm]] cases>>
@
% Nice simplification :) just needs that!
% Dont care about permission, time, inode-id, etc. 

% deduplicating! share subdir if no change.

I will present in Chapter~\ref{chap:advanced-features} a few 
more file types supported by Git (e.g., symbolic links, submodules).
\n ref{sec:symlinks} ref{sec:submodules}

Note that a tree entry does not specify the used id ([[uid]]) or
group id ([[gid]]) of a file, or the read-write-execute
permissions ([[rwx]]) of a file (except for the [[x]] with [[Exec]] above
to denote executable files).
%
Indeed, the repository must abstract away this kind of specific information.
Many people can collaborate with each other by working on the
same repository, so it would not make sense to favor any user or permission.
\l morever uid not stable acrosss machines

Git supports only a simple subset of \unix file types. It can not
store special files such as a socket, a named pipe, or a device file.

%alt: flat list of revision number for each file? how retrive file?
% if renamed? if removed?

% Merkel trees?
% Can reference entire tree with just hash of root tree! because
% This tree itself is hashed by its content.

\subsection{[[Commit.t]]}

%trans:
The last Git object, 
%
the commit, associates to a toplevel tree (again through its SHA1 binary hash) 
a set of parent commits, 
an author, 
a date,
and a commit message.

% =~ history
% each commit has a tree and a parent, so can trace history of full project.

<<type [[Commit.t]]>>=
type t = {
  tree     : Tree.hash; (* the root *)
  (* first commit has no parent, and merge commits have 2 parents *)
  parents  : hash list;
  (* note that User.t contains a time *)
  author   : User.t;
  message  : string;
  <<[[Commit.t]] extra fields>>
}
@
%crossref: Tree.hash (again indirectly via text above)

\ifallcode
<<[[Commit.t]] extra fields>>=
(* less: encoding, gpgsig, mergetag, extra *)
@
\fi

<<type [[Commit.hash]]>>=
and hash = Sha1.t
@

The [[User.t]] type below specifies the name and email of an author,
but also the date of the commit and the timezone of the author.
\t solve complicated time issue
%rcs: %sccs: had 2 digits for the year for a long time and was
% using local time

<<type [[User.t]]>>=
type t = {
  name : string;
  email: string;
  date : Int64.t (* seconds *) * timezone_offset;
}
@
%old: tz_offset (*option*)
\t int64, seconds, no 2032 issues

<<type [[User.tz_offset]]>>=
type timezone_offset = int (* +/- hours, [-12, +12] *)
@

%old:
% <<type User.tz_offset>>=
% type tz_offset = {
%   sign: sign;
%   hours: int;
%   min: int;
% }
% @
% <<type User.sign>>=
% type sign = Plus | Minus
% @

Git allows to differentiate who was the author of a modification
and who actually commited the modification to the repository.
\l useful? Linux email patch?

<<[[Commit.t]] extra fields>>=
committer: User.t;
@



% Fast checkout. Give me commit and I can grab
% all files from object store (looking first tree and then
% going recursively grabbing blobs on the way).
%rcs: innovated over slow sccs by storing diffs in reverse! fast checkout.

% DAG of version on top of tree of files. Subtle.
% Also merkle tree.

\section{References}

As I explained in Section~\ref{sec:references}, references,
which are mainly stored under [[.git/refs/]], are another
fundamental data structure of Git. 
%toc
References have 
a name (e.g., [[refs/heads/master]]), and 
a content (usually an hexadecimal SHA1 hash), 
as explained in the following sections.


%dup:
% Object store and reference store.

% kinda correspond to branch name.
% .git/refs/heads/xxx are branches.
% .git/HEAD is current branch (usually point to .git/refs/heads/master
%  but 'master' is really just a convention could be 'trunk' or whatever)
% then this simple model allow to encode many idioms:
% - remote push/pull .git/refs/remote/origin/master
% - tags (refs/tags/xxx)
% - stash
% - ?

%torvalds:
% And that's it! with objects and (atomic) refs, you can do everything!
% far more complicated to achieve the same in other VCSs.

\l when stuff under refs/... contain indirect ref? HEAD is indirect
\l ref, but when need indirect ref under refs/?

% then can even save history of those refs (the reflog).

%https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-References
%references vs symbolic references.

\subsection{Reference names}

% Valid branch name:

<<type [[Refs.refname]]>>=
(* should always start with "refs/", see is_refname() later *)
type refname = string (* e.g. "refs/heads/master" *)
@

The format of a reference name has a few constraints that
the type can not easily express:

<<signature [[Refs.is_valid_refname]]>>=
val is_refname: refname -> bool
@
<<function [[Refs.is_valid_refname]]>>=
let is_refname str =
  str =~ "^refs/"
  (* todo: git-check-ref-format *)
@
%old: was is_valid_refname, but more consistent with is_hexsha, etc

\subsection{[[HEAD]]}

Most references are stored under [[.git/refs/]], but Git maintains
also a special reference called the [[HEAD]] (see Section~\ref{sec:HEAD})
to point to the head of the current branch, hence the following type:

<<type [[Refs.t]]>>=
type t =
  | Head
  | Ref of refname
@
\t which functin can take either?

% used for? dumper?
<<signature [[Refs.string_of_ref]]>>=
val string_of_ref: t -> string
@
<<function [[Refs.string_of_ref]]>>=
let string_of_ref = function
  | Head -> "HEAD"
  | Ref x -> x
@

\subsection{Reference content}

Most references contain the SHA1 hexadecimal hash of a commit, but 
they can also contain the name of another reference:
\l actually type below use Commit.hash, so more consistent, but on disk its hexa

<<type [[Refs.ref_content]]>>=
type ref_content =
  (* the final value when follow all the pointers *)
  | Hash of Commit.hash
  (* pointer (may contain sha1 or another pointer again) *)
  | OtherRef of refname
@
%crossref: Commit.hash (said in text)


By default, [[HEAD]] points to another reference:

<<signature [[Refs.default_head_content]]>>=
val default_head_content: ref_content
@
<<constant [[Refs.default_head_content]]>>=
let default_head_content = 
  OtherRef "refs/heads/master"
@

% follow() later.

\subsection{Reference store}
%similar to Object store, indeed .git/ is mostly objects and refs (and index)

%trans:
Similar to the objects in Section~\ref{sec:object-store-function}
with [<Repository.hexsha_to_filename()>], the function below computes
the path of a reference:

<<function [[Repository.ref_to_filename]]>>=
let ref_to_filename r aref =
  match aref with
  | Refs.Head -> r.dotgit / "HEAD"
  (* less: win32: should actually replace '/' in name *)
  | Refs.Ref name -> r.dotgit / name
@


\subsection{Objectish references}

Many commands of Git requires a commit as a parameter, for example
[[git checkout]].
It is convenient for the user to be able to specify a commit either 
through its hexadecimal SHA1, or 
through the name of a branch, or
through a reference,
hence the type below:

<<type [[Repository.objectish]]>>=
(* todo: handle ^ like HEAD^, so need more complex objectish parser *)
type objectish =
  | ObjByRef of Refs.t
  | ObjByHex of Hexsha.t
  | ObjByBranch of string
  <<[[Repository.objectish]] cases>>
@
\l branch is shorter name than Refs.
%crossref: Hexsha.t, Refs.t

\ifallcode
<<[[Repository.objectish]] cases>>=
(* todo:  ObjByShortHex *)
@
\fi


\section{[[Index.t]]}
\label{sec:index}
% Staging area, Initially called DIRC, directory cache?

%trans:
The last important Git data structure is the index stored under
[[.git/index]].

<<function [[Repository.index_to_filename]]>>=
let index_to_filename r =
  r.dotgit / "index"
@


An index is a sorted list of entries (similar to [<Tree.t>])
where each entry associates to a path an SHA1 binary hash.

% Seen in Section X staging area. Marks. But in practice
% not set of files with marks. Instead full set of files
% and current blob SHA1.

% To know diff between working tree and HEAD.
%gitless: misfit paper says that you do not need staging area and that in fact
%  it causes misfits


<<type [[Index.t]]>>=
(* the entries are sorted (see compare_entries below) *)
type t = entry list
@

% flat list

<<type [[Index.entry]]>>=
(** The type for a Git index entry. *)
type entry = {
  (* relative path *)
  path  : Fpath.t;
  id    : Blob.hash;

  stats : stat_info;
}
@
%old: stage : int; (*?? *)

As opposed to [<Tree.entry>], an [<Index.entry>]
contains a path to a file (e.g., [[dir/bar.txt]]), not 
the {basename} of file or directory.
%crossref:
Indeed, the type of the [[id]] field above refers only to the SHA1 of a blob.
%%dup: even if not checked statically
%
Moreover, instead of a small set of file types, an index entry
contains the full \unix stat of a file (including its [[uid]] and [[gid]]):

% Here id can refer only to a Blob. No subtree like for Tree.
% An index is a flat list of files (sorted).

% Index.stats vs Tree.perm.

<<type [[Index.stat_info]]>>=
(** The type for file-system stat information. *)
type stat_info = {
  mode : mode;

  ctime: time;
  mtime: time;

  dev  : Int32.t;
  inode: Int32.t;

  uid  : Int32.t;
  gid  : Int32.t;

  size : Int32.t;
}
@
% all those info disappear once in Tree.entry.
\l useful dev/inode?

An index entry is specific to a user.
The goal of the index, which was initially called the {\em directory cache}
in the first version of Git,
is to access quickly information about a tracked file,
for example the timestamp of a file at the moment it was checkout.


<<type [[Index.mode]]>>=
and mode =
  (* no directory here *)
  | Normal
  | Exec
  <<[[Index.mode]] cases>>
@
\t note that no dir! flat files! FIGURE?


<<type [[Index.time]]>>=
(** The type for a time represented by its [lsb32] and [nsec] parts. *)
and time = {
  lsb32: Int32.t;
  nsec : Int32.t;
}
@
\t more than int64 here? nano second also in repo?

Most Git commands will need information from the index 
(e.g., [[git commit]]), or will modify the index (e.g., [[git add]]),
so the index is one of the fields of the [<Repository.t>] structure:

<<[[Repository.t]] index field>>=
mutable index: Index.t;
@

Opening a repository (with [<Repository.open_()>]),
will read the index from the repository. If there is no index file yet
(for example after [[git init]] and before the first [[git add]]),
then [[ocamlgit]] uses an empty index thanks to the constant below:

<<signature [[Index.empty]]>>=
val empty: t
@
<<constant [[Index.empty]]>>=
let empty = []
@

The function below helps to build an index entry from its subelements:

<<signature [[Index.mk_entry]]>>=
val mk_entry: Fpath.t -> Sha1.t -> Unix.stats -> entry
@
<<function [[Index.mk_entry]]>>=
let mk_entry relpath sha stats =
  { path = relpath;
    id = sha;
    stats = stat_info_of_lstats stats;
  }
@
%old:    stage = 0; (* ?? *)


<<signature [[Index.stat_info_of_lstats]]>>=
val stat_info_of_lstats: Unix.stats -> stat_info
@
<<function [[Index.stat_info_of_lstats]]>>=
let stat_info_of_lstats stats = 
    { ctime = { lsb32 = Int32.of_float stats.Unix.st_ctime; nsec = 0l };
      mtime = { lsb32 = Int32.of_float stats.Unix.st_mtime; nsec = 0l };
      dev = Int32.of_int stats.Unix.st_dev;
      inode = Int32.of_int stats.Unix.st_ino;
      mode = 
        (match stats.Unix.st_kind, stats.Unix.st_perm with
        | Unix.S_REG, p -> 
          if p land 0o100 = 0o100 
          then Exec 
          else Normal
        <<[[Index.stat_info_of_lstats()]] match kind and perm cases>>
        | _ -> failwith ("unsupported file type")
        );
      uid = Int32.of_int stats.Unix.st_uid;
      gid = Int32.of_int stats.Unix.st_gid;
      size = Int32.of_int stats.Unix.st_size;
    }

\chapter{Reading from a Repository}
\label{chap:reading}
\t should enforce that read every bytes

%trans:
Now that you know the types of the core data structures and how
they are represented in memory, we can look at the format of
those data structures on the disk. In this chapter, I will
describe the code that reads those data structures from the disk,
with the code of 
[<Repository.read_obj()>], 
[<Repository.read_ref()>], and 
[<Repository.read_index()>].
%
The next chapter will describe the code that writes those data 
structures on the disk.

% Saw init, does not create objects, just create dirs.
% Create also index. Will see later commands adding

\chapter{Main Functions}
\label{chap:main}

%trans: %dup: Assembler.nw
I now switch from the bottom-up approach started in Chapter~\ref{chap:core-ds}
to a top-down approach, starting in this chapter with the
main entry point of [[ocamlgit]]: [<Main.main()>].
%
The next chapters will then describe the code of the main Git commands.

%toc: before main(), important type.
% git works with commands, git cmd args
% where each command have own options and actions.

\section{Main commands}
\label{sec:main-commands}

[[ocamlgit]] is a single program, but it consists really of a set
of independent mini-programs: the different Git commands.
%
Each of those mini-programs, 
like [[ocamlgit]] itself, have
a name,
some usage documentation,
and a set of command-line options, hence the following type:

%\subsection{[[Cmd_.t]]}

<<type [[Cmd_.t]]>>=
type t = {
  name: string;
  usage: string;
  options: (Arg.key * Arg.spec * Arg.doc) list;

  (* the command! *)
  f: string list -> unit;
  (* less: man: when do git -help get short help, and with --help man page *)
}
@
%alt: use of 'Term.()' and '$' to not require globals for flags (src: ocaml-git)
% but not worth it. With split cmd_xxx.ml can have different globals in
% those different files.

%cvs: the one who introduced cvs xxx style instead of many programs? 
% (ci/co/...)

The last field of [<Cmd_.t>] is the {callback} function to call
to execute the Git command. It takes as a parameter the list
of command-line arguments that were not flags.

%\subsection{[[Cmds.main_commands]]}

The constant below contains the list of all the main Git commands. 
Each module defines its own [[cmd]] constant:

<<constant [[Cmds.main_commands]]>>=
let main_commands = [
  (* creating *)
  Cmd_init.cmd;
  Cmd_add.cmd;
  Cmd_rm.cmd;
  Cmd_commit.cmd;

  (* branching *)
  Cmd_branch.cmd;
  Cmd_checkout.cmd;
  Cmd_reset.cmd;
  
  (* inspecting *)
  Cmd_show.cmd;
  Cmd_diff.cmd;
  Cmd_log.cmd;
  Cmd_status.cmd;

  (* networking *)
  Cmd_pull.cmd;
  Cmd_push.cmd;
  Cmd_clone.cmd;
]
@
%todo: no merge 
%less: rebase

%chunks:
I will present gradually in the rest of the document the code
of all those commands.

% There is also extra_commands (for debugging) and Cmd_help.cmd (for help).

\section{[[Main.main()]]}

%trans:
I can finally present the entry point of [[ocamlgit]], which will
dispatch one of the Git commands.

<<toplevel [[Main._1]]>>=
let _ =
  main ()
@

<<function [[Main.main]]>>=
let main () =
  <<[[Main.main()]] GC settings>>
  <<[[Main.main()]] sanity check arguments>>
  else begin
    let cmd = 
      try 
        commands |> List.find (fun cmd -> cmd.Cmd_.name = Sys.argv.(1))
      with Not_found ->
        <<[[Main.main()]] print usage and exit>>
    in
    <<[[Main.main()]] execute [[cmd.f]]>>
  end
@


%old:
%<<constant Main.hcommands>>=
%let hcommands = 
%  commands |> List.map (fun cmd -> cmd.Cmd_.name, cmd) |> Hashtbl_.of_list
%@
% useless opti

The final list of commands below contains the main commands 
(see Section~\ref{sec:main-commands} above),
some extra commands to either help debug [[ocamlgit]] 
(see Appendix~\ref{chap:debugging-ocamlgit}) or to
provide advanced features (see Chapter~\ref{chap:advanced-commands}),
and the command to get help %, which I will present soon in
(see Section~\ref{sec:git-help}).

<<constant [[Main.commands]]>>=
let commands = List.flatten [
  Cmds.main_commands;
  Cmds.extra_commands;
  [Cmd_help.cmd];
]
@
%ocaml:
% Cmd_help reference itself main_commands, and ocaml forbids
% mutually recursive dependencies, so here it is.
% Extra is for git help vs git help --all?

%dup: Make.nw?
% Sanity check. obvious but necessary. will not comment

[[ocamlgit]] requires at least one argument: a Git command.
Thus, [[argv]] must contain at least two elements
(remember that [[argv.(0)]] contains the name of the program,
here [["ocamlgit"]]):


<<[[Main.main()]] sanity check arguments>>=
if Array.length Sys.argv < 2
then begin
  <<[[Main.main()]] print usage and exit>>
end
@
% git cmd xxx so at least 2.

<<[[Main.main()]] print usage and exit>>=
UConsole.print (usage ());
exit 1
@
\l split because used from 2 places
\l pr2?

<<function [[Main.usage]]>>=
let usage () =
  spf "usage: ocamlgit <%s> [options]"
    (String.concat "|" (commands |> List.map (fun cmd -> cmd.Cmd_.name)))
@
% See Section~{sec:git-command-line}


The code to sanity check arguments above is necessary but often obvious.
This is why I will usually not comment such code in the rest of this document.

% compute arguments and dispatch command callback.

Executing the command callback requires first to build a new
[[argv]] (without the leading [["ocamlgit"]]), to have a new
usage message specific to the command, and finally to process
the new [[argv]] to separate flags and options from the remaining
arguments of the command:

<<[[Main.main()]] execute [[cmd.f]]>>=
let argv = Array.sub Sys.argv 1 (Array.length Sys.argv -1) in
let usage_msg_cmd = spf "usage: %s %s%s"
  (Filename.basename Sys.argv.(0))
  cmd.Cmd_.name
  cmd.Cmd_.usage
in
let remaining_args = ref [] in
<<[[Main.main()]] parse [[argv]] for cmd options and [[remaining_args]]>>
(* finally! *)
try 
  cmd.Cmd_.f (List.rev !remaining_args)
with 
  | Cmd_.ShowUsage ->
    Arg.usage (Arg.align cmd.Cmd_.options) usage_msg_cmd;
    exit 1
@

The exception below will be used from command callbacks to indicate
that something was wrong with the command-line arguments:

<<exception [[Cmd_.ShowUsage]]>>=
(* Cmd_.f can raise ShowUsage. It will be catched by Main.main *)
exception ShowUsage
@

Processing the new [[argv]] is similar to what most OCaml programs do
and it involves the [[Arg]] module:


<<[[Main.main()]] parse [[argv]] for cmd options and [[remaining_args]]>>=
(try 
 (* todo: look if --help and factorize treatment of usage for subcmds *)
   Arg.parse_argv argv (Arg.align cmd.Cmd_.options) 
     (fun arg -> Stack_.push arg remaining_args) usage_msg_cmd;
 with Arg.Bad str | Arg.Help str->  
   prerr_string str;
   exit 1
);
@




\section{Getting help: [[git help]]}
\label{sec:git-help}

Here is the code of the first Git command, the command to get
help with [[git help]]:
% First command example, simple:

<<constant [[Cmd_help.list_extra]]>>=
let list_extra = ref false
@

<<constant [[Cmd_help.cmd]]>>=
let rec cmd = { Cmd_.
  name = "help";
  usage = "";
  options = ["-a", Arg.Set list_extra, " see all commands"];
  f = (fun _args ->
    let xs = 
      if !list_extra
      then Cmds.main_commands @ Cmds.extra_commands @ [cmd]
      else Cmds.main_commands
    in
    UConsole.print ("Available commands: ");
    xs |> List.iter (fun cmd ->
      UConsole.print (spf "  %s" cmd.Cmd_.name);
    );
  );
}
@
\l also git command --help later

%ocaml:
Note that this command references itself, 
hence the [[rec]] keyword above.
\l not a function but still rec
%crossref:
Moreover, this command also references [<Cmds.main_commands>];
this is why [<Cmd_help.cmd>] could not be part of the list
of main commands earlier in Section~\ref{sec:main-commands}
(OCaml does not allow mutually recursive modules).
\l actually it does, but weird extension, and not for toplevel module/files?

Here is the output of [[git help]]:
\begin{verbatim}
1 $ git help
Available commands: 
  init
  add
  rm
  commit
  branch
  checkout
  reset
  show
  diff
  log
  status
  pull
  push
  clone
\end{verbatim}



\chapter{Creating a Repository}
\label{chap:creating}
\n Initializing? reserved for 'creating empty', so would match only git init

In this chapter, we will explore the different ways to create
a Git repository.
\l Most common is create fresh repo, other is clone.

\section{Initializing a new repository: [[git init]]}
% Creating a fresh repository

The simplest way to create a new repository is to run
the command [[git init]] from a directory, as shown in
Section~\ref{sec:getting-started}.
%trans-dull:
Here is the code describing this command:

<<constant [[Cmd_init.cmd]]>>=
let cmd = { Cmd_.
  name = "init";
  usage = " [directory]";
  options = [
   <<[[Cmd_init.cmd]] command-line options>>
  ];
  f = (fun args ->
    match args with
    | []    -> Repository.init (Fpath.v ".")
    | [dir] -> Repository.init (Fpath.v dir)
    | _ -> raise Cmd_.ShowUsage
  );
}
@

%crossref: Cmd_.ShowUsage

\ifallcode
<<[[Cmd_init.cmd]] command-line options>>=
(* less: -bare, --quiet *)
@
\fi

As I explained in Section~\ref{sec:git-tutorial-init}, initializing
a fresh repository consists mainly in creating a directory
structure under [[.git/]], without any objects in it.

<<signature [[Repository.init]]>>=
val init: Fpath.t -> unit
@
<<function [[Repository.init]]>>=
let init (root : Fpath.t) =
  if not (Sys.file_exists !!root)
  then Unix.mkdir !!root dirperm;

  (* less: bare argument? so no .git/ prefix? *)
  let dirs = [
    ".git";
    ".git/objects";
    ".git/refs";
    ".git/refs/heads";
    ".git/refs/tags";
    ".git/refs/remote";
    ".git/refs/remote/origin";
    ".git/hooks";
    ".git/info";
  ] in
  dirs |> List.iter (fun dir ->
    (* less: exn if already there? *)
    Unix.mkdir !!(root / dir) dirperm;
  );
  <<[[Repository.init()]] create [[.git/HEAD]]>>

  (* less: config file, description, hooks, etc *)
  Sys.chdir !!root;
  let absolute = Sys.getcwd () |> Fpath.v in
  UConsole.print (spf "Initialized empty Git repository in %s" !!(absolute / ".git/"))
@


<<constant [[Repository.dirperm]]>>=
(* rwxr-x--- *)
let dirperm = 0o750
@

[[git init]] also creates the special reference [[HEAD]] stored
in [[.git/HEAD]], and initializes its content with
a reference to the master branch 
%crossref:
(see the content of [<Refs.default_head_content>]).


<<[[Repository.init()]] create [[.git/HEAD]]>>=
let r = {
  worktree = root;
  dotgit = root / ".git";
  index = Index.empty;
} in
add_ref_if_new r Refs.Head Refs.default_head_content |> ignore;
@
\l will see add_ref_if_new later.
%crossref: Index.empty

%crossref:
I will explain the code of [<Repository.add_ref_if_new()>] later
and why it has [[_if_new]] in its name.

%\subsection{Common directory}
% To abstract diff between bare and normal repository

%\subsection{Named files}

\section{Copying an existing repository: [[cp -r]]}

Another way to create a repository is to copy an existing
one with a simple command such as [[cp -r]].
\t well, can just do cp :) simple! DVCS power! distributed!
%
This is also an easy way to create a new branch, even
though it is not an optimal one (space and speed-wise).
\l can also use branch, see later.
You wull see a more efficient way to manage branches
in Chapter~\ref{chap:branching}.

\t actually at FB some people (Ola?) were prefering copy to
% branch cos git was not scaling enough when lots of files
% so switching branch was too slow (but doing cd /other/repo was fast)


\section{Cloning an existing repository: [[git clone]]}

%trans:
Using [[cp -r]] requires to have access to the original repository
through the filesystem, which usually limits yourself
to local repositories on your disk 
(unless you use a distributed filesystem such as NFS).
\l cite NFS? or plan9 import?
A more flexible way to copy an existing repository is to use
the command [[git clone]], which accepts a URL as an argument.
\n URL can be local too actually, even without file://
%
Here is the command to clone the repository containing the
code of [[ocamlgit]] itself:

%meta:
\begin{verbatim}
$ git clone http://github.com/aryx/plan9-ocaml
Cloning into 'plan9-ocaml'...
$ cd plan9-ocaml/version-control/
$ ls
IO_.ml            cmd_checkout.ml  diff.mli          refs.ml
...
\end{verbatim}
\n can also use https (default), but need ssl then?

Cloning a repository does not just copy it; it also keeps
a reference to the remote repository 
(in [[refs/remotes/origin/HEAD]]). This reference will allow
later to {\em push} and {\em pull} updates from the repository
(see Chapter~\ref{chap:exchanging}).

I will describe the code of [[git clone]] later in 
Section~\ref{sec:git-clone}, after I describe
the client/server architecture of Git and the code to
pack objects together in Chapter~\ref{chap:packing}.


%\section{Checking out a repository: [[git checkout]]}
% if cp -a just .git, then can checkout by doing git checkout.

%\section{Fast Import/Export}
%adv topics


\section{Opening a repository}

The Git commands in the following chapters all assume they
are run from an existing repository.
%
Here is the function to open a repository and get a
[<Repository.t>] record:

<<signature [[Repository.open_]]>>=
val open_: Fpath.t -> t
@
% not open cos conflict with ocaml keyword
<<function [[Repository.open_]]>>=
let open_ (root : Fpath.t) = 
  let path = root / ".git" in
  if Sys.file_exists !!path &&
     (Unix.stat !!path).Unix.st_kind = Unix.S_DIR
  then 
    { worktree = root;
      dotgit = path;
      <<[[Repository.open_()]] other fields settings>>
    }
  else failwith (spf "Not a git repository at %s" !!root)
@
%todo: bar repo, 
\l cant used index_to_filename cos no repo yet, sad.

As I explained in Section~\ref{sec:index}, most Git commands
will also need to read or write information in the index,
so opening a repository also reads its index:

<<[[Repository.open_()]] other fields settings>>=
index = 
  (if Sys.file_exists !!(path / "index")
   then 
    (path / "index") |> UChan.with_open_in (fun (ch : Chan.i) ->
      ch.ic |> IO.input_channel |> Index.read)
   else Index.empty
  );
@
%crossref: Index.empty

\ifallcode
<<[[Repository.open_()]] other fields settings>>=
(* less: grafts, hooks *)
@
\fi

% See appendix for IO.xxx, Common.with_file_in

%crossref:
I described before the code of [<Index.read()>] called above.


It is convenient for the user to be able to run a Git command
from anywhere inside the repository, not just from its root.
\l For example in Section~\ref{}, git add from dir1.
However, it is simpler, while implementing the code of the
different Git commands, to assume that every paths are
relative to the root of the repository.
Avoiding variation in data usually simplifies things.
Moreover, some data structures such as the index entries 
must contain relative paths.
%
The function below allows to satisfy both requirements
by converting any filenames given on the command-line
to relative filenames, and to find the root of the
repository:


% Most git commands can operate from the top dir of a object
% or any subdirectory. Convenient, git add foo.txt from
% any dir, no need go back to top.
% But internally simple have canonical representation of
% path and always use relative path to top dir.
% Enter find_root_... helper function used first in many commands.

<<signature [[Repository.find_dotgit_root_and_open]]>>=
val find_root_open_and_adjust_paths: 
 Fpath.t list -> t * Fpath.t list
@
<<function [[Repository.find_dotgit_root_and_open]]>>=
let find_root_open_and_adjust_paths (paths : Fpath.t list) : t * Fpath.t list = 
  (* todo: allow git from different location *)
  let r = open_ (Fpath.v ".") in
  (* todo: support also absolute paths and transform in relpaths *)
  let relpaths = paths |> List.map (fun path ->
    if Filename.is_relative !!path
    then 
      (* todo: may have to adjust if root was not pwd *)
      path
    else failwith (spf "TODO: Not a relative path: %s" !!path)
    )
  in
  r, relpaths
@
\t TODO implement flexible scheme



\chapter{Staging a Diff}
\label{chap:staging}

%trans:
Once you created a repository, you can 
add,
remove, 
modify, or
rename 
files in this repository, as explained in the following sections.
%
In Git, doing those modifications requires two steps:
first you stage your modification, and 
then you commit the modification
%dup: overview/git-concepts/staging-area
(which gives flexibility in the commit process, as explained 
in Section~\ref{sec:staging-area}).
%gitless: staging is not necessary.
% But if modified a b c and want different commits, then can!
% (can even use magit-status and pick each changes!)
This chapter is concerned only with the first part: the staging.
The next chapter will cover the commit.

\section{Adding files: [[git add]]}
% Adding and modifying

%trans-dull:
Here is the code of the command to add a file or set of files
to the staging area:

<<constant [[Cmd_add.cmd]]>>=
let cmd = { Cmd_.
  name = "add";
  usage = " <file>..."; (* less: pathspec? *)
  options = [
    <<[[Cmd_add.cmd]] command-line options>>
  ];
  f = (fun args ->
    match args with
    | [] -> Logs.app (fun m -> m "Nothing specified, nothing added.")
    | xs ->
      let r, relpaths = Repository.find_root_open_and_adjust_paths (Fpath_.of_strings xs) in
      (* less: support directories *)
      add r relpaths
  );
}
@

\ifallcode
<<[[Cmd_add.cmd]] command-line options>>=
(* todo: --interactive, --patch for picking, --force (if ignored) 
 * --all, 
 * --recursive
 *)
@
\fi

%dup: overview/hello.git/staging
Note that you must use [[git add]] both when adding a new file to
the repository and when adding a new version of a file that
was already in the repository.
%(also called a {tracked} file).
%
In some senses, Git does not care whether the file is new 
or not. In both cases, Git just adds the current version
of a file in the staging area.

Adding files to the staging area translates internally in adding
them to the index:

<<function [[Cmd_add.add]]>>=
let add r relpaths = 
  (* this will also add some blobs to the object store *)
  Repository.add_in_index r relpaths
@

% build a series of tree objects if different from last one?
% No, commit does that. Here we just add blobs.

% Note that git add is to add new file to repo but also
% to add existing modified file to the commit!

% if git add foo.txt, then modif, then git add other one
% then 2 objects (and one "stale", git gc can clean it)

\section{Creating a blob from a file}

Adding a set of files in the index consists simply in
iterating over those files, modifying the index, and
finally writing back the modified index on the disk:

<<signature [[Repository.add_in_index]]>>=
val add_in_index: t -> Fpath.t list -> unit
@

% create blob and add object! so 'git add' add object to repo.
% if git add again same file then old object is useless (git gc).

<<function [[Repository.add_in_index]]>>=
let add_in_index (r : t) (relpaths : Fpath.t list) : unit =
  <<[[Repository.add_in_index()]] sanity check [[relpaths]]>>
  relpaths |> List.iter (fun relpath ->
    <<[[Repository.add_in_index()]] adding [[relpath]]>>
  );
  write_index r
@
%old: was called stage() in dulwich
\l sanitize fs_path (win32)

%crossref:
I described before the code of [<Repository.write_index()>] called above.

<<[[Repository.add_in_index()]] sanity check [[relpaths]]>>=
assert (relpaths |> List.for_all (fun p -> Filename.is_relative !!p));
@

Adding a file in the index 
creates first a new blob object with the content of the added file.
Then, [[add_in_index()]] adds the blob to the object store, and finally
adds (or replaces) an entry in the index:

<<[[Repository.add_in_index()]] adding [[relpath]]>>=
let full_path = r.worktree // relpath in
let stat = 
  try Unix.lstat !!full_path 
  with Unix.Unix_error _ ->
    failwith (spf "Repository.add_in_index: %s does not exist anymore"
                !!relpath)
in
let blob = Objects.Blob (content_from_path_and_unix_stat full_path stat) in
let sha = add_obj r blob in
let entry = Index.mk_entry relpath sha stat in
r.index <- Index.add_entry r.index entry;
@

%crossref:
I described before the general function [<Repository.add_obj()>] called above,
and the specific code it uses to write a blob in [<Blob.write()>].
%crossref: Index.mk_entry (meh)

Note that the code above uses [[Unix.lstat()]], and not [[Unix.stat()]] 
to deal with symbolic links (see Section~\ref{sec:symlinks} for
more information on how Git handles symblic links).

Remember from Section~\ref{sec:index} that the index contains
sorted entries, so [[Index.add_entry()]] below must add the new entry
at the right place:

<<signature [[Index.add_entry]]>>=
val add_entry: t -> entry -> t
@
<<function [[Index.add_entry]]>>=
let rec add_entry idx entry =
  match idx with
  | [] -> [entry]
  | x::xs ->
    (match entry.path <=> x.path with
    | Greater -> x::(add_entry xs entry)
    (* replacing old entry, new version of tracked file  *)
    | Equal -> entry::xs
    (* new file (the entries are sorted, no need to go through xs) *)
    | Less -> entry::x::xs
    )
@
%crossref:
The [[<=>]] operator used above is not a standard OCaml operator.
It is inspired by a similar operator in Perl that compares
values. It returns 
[[Equal]] if both values are equal,
[[Sup]] if the first value is superior to the second one, or
[[Inf]] if it is inferior.
I show the code of [[<=>]] in Appendix~\ref{chap:utilities}.

<<function [[Repository.content_from_path_and_unix_stat]]>>=
let content_from_path_and_unix_stat (full_path : Fpath.t) (stat : Unix.stats) : string =
  match stat.Unix.st_kind with
  <<[[Repository.content_from_path_and_unix_stat()]] match kind cases>>
  | Unix.S_REG ->
    full_path |> UChan.with_open_in (fun (ch : Chan.i) ->
      ch.ic |> IO.input_channel |> IO.read_all
    )
  | _ -> failwith (spf "Repository.add_in_index: %s kind not handled" 
                     !!full_path)
@
\n not Blob.read here! even though same function called in the end.

% blob can be a symlink! git allows to store symlinks.

% Order of operation is important. Always in a consistent state.
% Will add index entry only if blob has been added! if failure after
% blob created, no pb!

\section{Removing files: [[git rm]]}

<<constant [[Cmd_rm.cmd]]>>=
let cmd = { Cmd_.
  name = "rm";
  usage = " [options] <file>...";
  options = [
    <<[[Cmd_rm.cmd]] command-line options>>
  ];
  f = (fun args ->
    match args with
    | [] -> raise Cmd_.ShowUsage
    | xs ->
      let r, relpaths = Repository.find_root_open_and_adjust_paths (Fpath_.of_strings xs) in
      rm r relpaths
  );

The code for removing a file or set of files is even simpler. 
We just need to remove some entries from the index and write back the index.
%
Indeed, as you will see in Chapter~\ref{chap:committing}, committing
what was staged consists mainly in creating a set of tree objects
from the flat list of files in the index. 
%
If a file is not anymore in the index, then it will also not 
be part of any of those trees.


<<function [[Cmd_rm.rm]]>>=
let rm r relpaths =
  (* less: not super efficient, could use hashes to speedup things *)
  r.Repository.index <-
    relpaths |> List.fold_left (fun idx relpath ->
          (* todo: -f? remove also file *)
      Index.remove_entry idx relpath
    ) r.Repository.index;
  Repository.write_index r
@
%  (* removing is simpler than adding; no need to add blobs in
%   * the object store, so can just use functions from Index
%   *)

%crossref: Repository.write_index again

[[Index.remove_entry()]] just does the opposite
of [<Index.add_entry()>] in the previous section

<<signature [[Index.remove_entry]]>>=
val remove_entry: t -> Fpath.t -> t
@
<<function [[Index.remove_entry]]>>=
let rec remove_entry idx (name : Fpath.t) =
  match idx with
  | [] -> failwith (spf "The file %s is not in the index" !!name)
  | x::xs ->
    (match name <=> x.path with
    | Greater -> x::(remove_entry xs name)
    | Equal -> xs
    (* the entries are sorted *)
    | Less -> failwith (spf "The file %s is not in the index" !!name)
    )
@

% when rm, we just want to build from index a tree without
% this entry. Simple.

% Does not remove from working tree. Or need rm -f.
% (Otherwise will be listed as untracked, see Section~\ref{x}).

\section{Renaming files: [[git mv]]}

% huge debate. How to track rename of files and dirs.
%cvs: was terrible at renaming

%git: Just add and rm.
% Note that same sha1 when rename, because same content, so no space lost.

% See later how git handle remames in git log foo.txt, to try to
% infer renames.
% Sha1 can be used to quickly detect renames when explore history.
% See Section~{X}.

\section{Computing the trees from an index}

The algorithm to transform an index in a set of trees operates in two steps:
\begin{enumerate}

\item The algorithm goes though all the files in the index to group them
by directories while populating the local hashtable [[dirs]]

\item The algorithm builds tree objects by going recursively through
the hashtable [[dirs]] and returns the SHA1 hash of the toplevel tree

\end{enumerate}

% FIGURE, flat index to tree.

%trans-dull:
Here is the type and skeleton of [[Index.trees_of_index()]]:

<<signature [[Index.trees_of_index]]>>=
val trees_of_index: t -> (* add_obj *)(Tree.t -> Tree.hash) -> Tree.hash
@
<<function [[Index.trees_of_index]]>>=
let trees_of_index idx add_tree_obj =
  let (dirs: dirs) = Hashtbl.create 11 in
  (* populate dirs *)
  <<[[Index.trees_of_index()]] populate [[dirs]]>>
  (* build trees *)
  <<[[Index.trees_of_index()]] build trees from [[dirs]]>>
@

\subsection{Grouping index files by directories}

%trans-dull:
Here is the type of the hashtbl [[dirs]] grouping files 
by directory:

<<type [[Index.dirs]]>>=
type dirs = (Fpath.t (* full relpath of dir *), dir) Hashtbl.t
@

<<type [[Index.dir]]>>=
type dir = dir_entry list ref
@
<<type [[Index.dir_entry]]>>=
  and dir_entry =
    | Subdir of string (* basename *)
    | File of string (* basename *) * entry
@

%trans-dull:
Here is the code to populate the [[dirs]] hashtable:

<<[[Index.trees_of_index()]] populate [[dirs]]>>=
Hashtbl.add dirs (Fpath.v ".") (ref []);
idx |> List.iter (fun entry ->
  let relpath : Fpath.t = entry.path in
  let (dirpath, base) = Filename.dirname !!relpath, Filename.basename !!relpath in
  let dir = find_dir dirs (Fpath.v dirpath) in
  dir := (File (base, entry))::!dir
);
@

%trans-dull:
Finding the directory of a file uses the function below:

<<function [[Index.add_dir]]>>=
let rec find_dir (dirs : dirs) (dirpath : Fpath.t) : dir =
  try 
    Hashtbl.find dirs dirpath
  with Not_found ->
    let newdir = ref [] in
    Hashtbl.add dirs dirpath newdir;
    <<[[Index.add_dir()]] recurse on parent of [[dirpath]]>>
    newdir
@


% FIGURE for trees.
% It maps relative path of dir to dir content

Note that adding a new directory in [[dirs]] requires also to
recursively add its parent:

<<[[Index.add_dir()]] recurse on parent of [[dirpath]]>>=
let (parent, base) = 
  Filename.dirname !!dirpath, Filename.basename !!dirpath in
(* !recursive call! should stop at some point because "." is in dirs *)
let dir = find_dir dirs (Fpath.v parent) in
dir := Subdir (base)::!dir;
@

The recursion stops because [[dirs]] is initialized with an
entry for [['.']] and [[Filename.dirname]] eventually returns [['.']]
when it reaches the toplevel directory.

\subsection{Building trees from directories}

%trans-dull:
Here is the second step of the [[trees_of_index()]] algorithm,
which builds a set of trees from [[dirs]] recursively starting
from the root directory [['.']].

<<[[Index.trees_of_index()]] build trees from [[dirs]]>>=
build_trees dirs (Fpath.v ".") add_tree_obj
@

<<function [[Index.build_trees]]>>=
let rec build_trees (dirs : dirs) (dirpath : Fpath.t) add_tree_obj =
  let dir = Hashtbl.find dirs dirpath in
  (* entries of a Tree.t must be sorted, but entries of an index too,
   * so we can assume add_dir was called in sorted order
   *)
  let xs = List.rev !dir in
  let tree = 
    xs |> List.map (function
      | File (base, entry) ->
        {Tree.
         name = base; 
         id = entry.id; 
         perm = perm_of_mode entry.stats.mode;
        }
      | Subdir base ->
        (* recurse *)
        let sha = 
          build_trees dirs (dirpath / base) add_tree_obj in
        {Tree. perm = Tree.Dir; name = base; id = sha }
    )
  in
  add_tree_obj tree
@

The function [[add_tree_obj()]] above will not only add a tree object
the repository. It will also return its SHA1.
%
Its value ([[fun t -> add_obj (Tree t)]]) is passed down to
[[build_trees]] from [<Repository.commit_index()>].


%trans-dull:
The code above relies on the helper function below to
convert an [<Index.mode>] to a [<Tree.perm>]:

<<signature [[Index.perm_of_mode]]>>=
val perm_of_mode: mode -> Tree.perm
@
<<function [[Index.perm_of_mode]]>>=
let perm_of_mode mode = 
  match mode with
  | Normal -> Tree.Normal
  | Exec -> Tree.Exec
  | Link -> Tree.Link
  <<[[Index.perm_of_mode()]] match mode cases>>
@


\section{Storing the date, author, and committer}

%trans:
Once [<Repository.commit_index()>] computed the toplevel tree object
from the index, setting the other fields of the commit
object is trivial.

<<[[Cmd_commit.cmd]] command-line options>>=
"--author",    Arg.Set_string author, " <author>";
@
<<constant [[Cmd_commit.author]]>>=
let author = ref ""
@


<<[[Cmd_commit.cmd]] compute [[author]] user>>=
(* todo: read from .git/config or ~/.gitconfig *)
let author = 
  if !author = ""
  then { User.
         name = Unix.getlogin ();
         email = "todo@todo";
         date = today;
       }
  else raise Todo (* need parse author string *)
in
@


<<[[Cmd_commit.cmd]] compute [[today]]>>=
let today = 
  (Int64.of_float (Unix.time ()),
   (* todo: use localtime vs gmtime? *) -7 (* SF *))
in
@




<<[[Cmd_commit.cmd]] command-line options>>=
"--committer", Arg.Set_string committer, " <author>";
@
<<constant [[Cmd_commit.committer]]>>=
let committer = ref ""
@
<<[[Cmd_commit.cmd]] compute [[committer]] user>>=
let committer =
  if !committer = ""
  then author
  else raise Todo
in
@


% Use config for default, see adv topics.

\section{Recording the message}

<<[[Cmd_commit.cmd]] command-line options>>=
"-m",        Arg.Set_string message, " <msg> commit message";
"--message", Arg.Set_string message, " <msg> commit message";
@
<<constant [[Cmd_commit.message]]>>=
let message = ref ""
@
\t EDITOR here?


\section{Updating [[HEAD]] atomically}

%trans:
The last operation of [<Repository.commit_index()>] is to update [[HEAD]]
to point to the newly created commit object.
%
In fact, [[git commit]] does not update [[HEAD]] itself but
the head pointed by [[HEAD]] (e.g., [[.git/refs/heads/master]]),
hence the use of [<Repository.follow_ref()>] in the code of the next sections.
%
Updating this head must be done atomically.
\t why atomically?
%CVS:
\t CVS was first to consider set of files, but it did not have atomic update of
\t multiple files.
\t Here either everything goes, or nothing!
%
To do so, [<Repository.commit_index()>] rely on two different functions
to handle two different situations:
\begin{enumerate}
\item When this is the first commit and [[HEAD]] points to an head
that does not exist yet. In that case it calls [<Repository.add_ref_if_new()>].

\item When there was already an older previous commit.
In that case it calls [<Repository.set_ref_if_same_old()>].
\end{enumerate}

%concurrency:
% need atomic operations for updating the refs, because
% push/pull will modify other repos that may be concurrently
% accessed by another user at the same time.
%why important atomic? because when push, you will write to another
% repo, and you will modify refs possibly? so need atomic?

%torvalds: simple, just need update the ref! no need lock
% on set of files (immutable hashed objects), just lock
% one ref, refs/heads/master (or other branch name)

% Can have pb, in which case just stale objects? (git gc)

<<[[Repository.commit_index()]] add ref when first commit>>=
add_ref_if_new r aref (Refs.Hash sha)
@
<<[[Repository.commit_index()]] update ref when not first commit>>=
set_ref_if_same_old r aref old_head sha
@

Both functions above return a boolean indicating whether the
operation could be done atomically.
%
For example, [<Repository.set_ref_if_same_old()>] will return false
if while modifying the reference, another process modified
it before and the current value is not anymore the old one
read before.

\subsection{Creating a new reference (first commit)}

Creating the first commit and the first head atomically
requires to make sure that while creating the reference file,
nobody else created the same file.
\t race between time read ref and see no sha and time write file
\t not that with_file_out_with_lock not enough.
%, so that the reference is indeed a new reference 
% (hence the name of the function).

val add_ref_if_new: t -> Refs.t -> Refs.ref_content -> bool
@
<<function [[Repository.add_ref_if_new]]>>=

  let (refs, shaopt) = follow_ref r aref in

\chapter{Branching}
\label{chap:branching}
% branching, aka fork.

In this chapter, you will see the code to manipulate branches.
Git uses the same command, [[git branch]], whose code is below, to 
list,
create, and
delete branches
depending on the command-line arguments.
%
You will also see in this chapter the code of 
[[git checkout]] to switch between branches, and 
[[git reset]] to reset all modifications done while working on the
current branch.

%dup: (but expanded?) intro/motivations
% purpose: parallel development (!= concurrent development)

%gitless: records working version of files, so can easily switch branch!
% no problem if got uncommitted stuff in current dir or untracked file
% that conflicts with tracked file in another branch, it will be saved!
% in gitless, it really is like you had 2 separate dirs with 2
%  separate working versions!

% Again can simply use cp and create another repo :)

% Branch operations are very simple. Just list/create/delete
% entries under refs/.
% cheap
%cvs: was terrible at managing branch. Relied on RCS branch mechanism,
% which was per file with complex encoding 1.1.1.1 and file format
% (forward-deltas on top of reverse-deltas).

\section{Listing branches: [[git branch]]}

To list the set of {active} branches, you just need to call
[[git branch]] without any argument:

<<[[Cmd_branch.cmd]] match args cases>>=
| [] -> list_branches r
@

Here is the output of [[git branch]] on a repository with
only two branches. 
[[git branch]] {marks} the current branch with a [[*]] before its name.

\begin{verbatim}
1 $ git branch
  experiment

\end{verbatim}

%trans-dull:
Here is the code of [[list_branches()]]:

<<function [[Cmd_branch.list_branches]]>>=

  let all_refs = Repository.all_refs r in

    if refname =~ "^refs/heads/\\(.*\\)"
    then 
      let short = Regexp_.matched1 refname in
      let prefix = 
        if (Refs.OtherRef refname = head_branch)
        then "* "

@
%crossref: Regexp_.matched1 in appendix

%crossref:
I described before the code of [<Repository.read_ref()>].
%
Thanks to the simplicity of how Git stores references on the disk,
getting all the references consists just in walking
the [[.git/refs/]] directory:

<<signature [[Repository.all_refs]]>>=
val all_refs: t -> Refs.refname list
@
<<function [[Repository.all_refs]]>>=
let all_refs (r : t) : Refs.refname list =
  let root = r.dotgit in
  let rootlen = String.length !!root in
  let res = ref [] in
  (root / "refs") |> walk_dir (fun path _dirs files ->
    files |> List.iter (fun file ->
      (* less: replace os.path.sep *)
      let dir = String.sub !!path rootlen (String.length !!path - rootlen) in
      let refname = Fpath.v dir / file in
      Stack_.push !!refname res
    );
   );
  List.rev !res
@

%crossref: walk_dir appendix
The code above relies on the utility function [<Repository.walk_dir()>]
to explore recursively a directory 
(see Appendix~\ref{chap:utilities} for its code).
%
This function takes a callback function and a directory as parameters
and calls the callback for each subdirectories of the directory parameter.
%
The callback is called with three arguments: 
the path of the current subdirectory,
the immediate subdirectories in this subdirectory, and 
the immediate files in this subdirectory.



\section{Creating a branch: [[git branch <name>]]}
\label{sec:create-branch}

To create a new branch, you need to call [[git branch]] with one
argument: the name of the desired branch.

<<[[Cmd_branch.cmd]] match args cases>>=

| [name] ->
  (match () with
  <<[[Cmd_branch.cmd]] when one argument, when flags cases>>
  | _ -> create_branch r name
  )
@

%repeat_code:
Creating a branch simply creates a new reference with the same
SHA1 than the SHA1 of the last commit in the current branch:

<<function [[Cmd_branch.create_branch]]>>=
let create_branch r name (* sha *) =
  let refname = "refs/heads/" ^ name in
  <<[[Cmd_branch.create_branch()]] sanity check refname>>
  let sha = Repository.follow_ref_some r (Refs.Head) in
  let ok = Repository.add_ref_if_new r (Refs.Ref refname) (Refs.Hash sha) in
  if not ok
  then failwith (spf "could not create branch '%s'" name)
@
%crossref: follow_ref_some and add_ref_if_new talked before

% cheap! (ok checkout takes time)
% and then usually checkout!

<<[[Cmd_branch.create_branch()]] sanity check refname>>=
let all_refs = Repository.all_refs r in
if List.mem refname all_refs
(* less: unless -force *)
then failwith (spf "A branch named '%s' already exists." name);
@

\section{Deleting a branch: [[git branch -d <name>]]}

%trans:
Finally, to delete a branch, adds the [[-d]] (or [[-D]]) command-line
flag before the name of the branch:

<<[[Cmd_branch.cmd]] command-line options>>=

<<[[Cmd_branch.cmd]] when one argument, when flags cases>>=
| _ when !del_flag  -> delete_branch r name false
@



<<[[Cmd_branch.cmd]] when one argument, when flags cases>>=
| _ when !del_force -> delete_branch r name true
@
<<[[Cmd_branch.cmd]] command-line options>>=
"-D",       Arg.Set del_force, " delete branch (even if not merged)";

  Repository.del_ref r aref;
  UConsole.print (spf "Deleted branch %s (was %s)" name (Hexsha.of_sha sha))
@

Deleting a branch consists simply in deleting a reference file
under [[.git/refs]]:

<<signature [[Repository.del_ref]]>>=
val del_ref: t -> Refs.t -> unit
@
<<function [[Repository.del_ref]]>>=
let del_ref r aref =

This command has also multiple operation modes depending on the
its command-line arguments.
%
With an argument, [[git checkout]] will switch the current branch:

<<[[Cmd_checkout.cmd]] match args cases>>=
| [str] -> checkout r str
@

This argument can be the name of a branch (e.g., [[git checkout experiment]]),
but also a string denotting a past commit (e.g., [[git checkout 19d977]]).
%
Here is the code below to deal with a branch name as an argument:

<<function [[Cmd_checkout.checkout]]>>=
let checkout r str =
  let all_refs = Repository.all_refs r in
  let refname = "refs/heads/" ^ str in

  match () with
  | _ when List.mem refname all_refs ->
    let commitid = Repository.follow_ref_some r (Refs.Ref refname) in
    let commit = Repository.read_commit r commitid in
    let tree = Repository.read_tree r commit.Commit.tree in

    (* todo: order of operation? set ref before index? reverse? *)
    Repository.write_ref r (Refs.Head) (Refs.OtherRef refname);
    Repository.set_worktree_and_index_to_tree r tree;
    UConsole.print (spf "Switched to branch '%s'" str);
    (* less: if master, then check if up-to-date with origin/master *)

  <<[[Cmd_checkout.checkout()]] cases>>
  | _ -> raise Cmd_.ShowUsage
@

To checkout a branch, the code above first finds the commit
associated with the reference of the branch, 
then reads it from the disk
%crossref:
(see the code of [<Repository.read_commit()>]), and then read its
tree 
(see the code of [<Repository.read_tree()>]).
Then, most of the heavy work is done by 
[<Repository.set_worktree_and_index_to_tree()>], which I will present
in the next section.


% reset_index use for checkout!

% build_index and also set worktree from tree.

\section{Resetting a branch: [[git reset]]}

Resetting a branch is useful for example you want to quickly
undo the modifications you have done to your working files.
\t other examples?
%
To do so you must use the [[git reset]] command with
the [[-hard]] command-line flag.
%
Indeed, there are multiple ways to reset a branch, as shown
by the code and flags below:

<<constant [[Cmd_reset.cmd]]>>=
let cmd = { Cmd_.
  name = "reset";
  usage = " [options] ";
  options = [
    <<[[Cmd_reset.cmd]] command-line options>>
  ];
  f = (fun args ->
    let r, _ = Repository.find_root_open_and_adjust_paths [] in
    match args with
    | [] -> 
      (match () with
      <<[[Cmd_reset.cmd.f()]] when no args, cases>>
      | _ -> raise Cmd_.ShowUsage
      )
    | _ -> raise Cmd_.ShowUsage
  );
}
@


\ifallcode
<<[[Cmd_reset.cmd]] command-line options>>=
(* less: or: git reset <paths>... *)
(* less: --patch, --quiet, --merge *)
@
\fi

<<[[Cmd_reset.cmd]] command-line options>>=
"--hard", Arg.Set hard, " reset HEAD, index and working tree";
"--soft", Arg.Set soft, " reset only HEAD";
"--mixed", Arg.Set mixed, " reset HEAD and index";
@

<<constant [[Cmd_reset.hard]]>>=
let hard = ref false
@
<<constant [[Cmd_reset.soft]]>>=
let soft = ref false
@
<<constant [[Cmd_reset.mixed]]>>=
let mixed = ref false
@

<<[[Cmd_reset.cmd.f()]] when no args, cases>>=
| _ when !hard -> reset_hard r
@

A hard reset is equivalent to checking out again
the commit of the current branch, and so the code
below can reuse [<Repository.set_worktree_and_index_to_tree()>]
used for the code of [[git checkout]].

<<function [[Cmd_reset.reset_hard]]>>=
let reset_hard r =
  let commitid = Repository.follow_ref_some r (Refs.Head) in
  let commit = Repository.read_commit r commitid in
  let tree = Repository.read_tree r commit.Commit.tree in

  Repository.set_worktree_and_index_to_tree r tree;
  UConsole.print (spf "HEAD is now at %s %s" 
        (String.sub (Hexsha.of_sha commitid) 0 6)
        (String.sub commit.Commit.message 0 40))
@

\t should also reset selectively files or dirs

<<[[Cmd_reset.cmd.f()]] if not hard reset>>=
if !soft || !mixed || not !hard
then begin
  pr2 "only --hard supported";
  raise Cmd_.ShowUsage
end

\chapter{Merging}
\label{chap:merging}
% "Integrating changes" in misfit paper

%trans: after fork, of course dual is merge

% for // devel but also concurrent devel. everyone is a branch.

% ??? no code in dulwich for merge? or just do_commit with multiple
% parents? the <<< >>> conflict is not part of git but can be third-party?

% MERGE_HEADS?

% saw merge_tag before in commit, and merge_heads in do_commit.

%torvalds:
% On need for clever merge:
% https://wincent.com/blog/a-look-back-bram-cohen-vs-linus-torvalds:

%"There is no need for fancy metadata, rename tracking and so forth. The
%only thing you need to store is the state of the tree before and after
%each change. What files were renamed? Which ones were copied? Which
%ones were deleted? What lines were added? Which ones were removed?
%Which lines had changes made inside them? Which slabs of text were
%copied from one file to another? You shouldn't have to care about any
%of these questions and you certainly shouldn't have to keep special
%tracking data in order to help you answer them: all the changes to the
%tree (additions, deletes, renames, edits etc) are implicitly encoded
%in the delta between the two states of the tree; you just track what
%is the content.
%
%Git is already very smart, and it can (and will) get smarter about
%figuring out what happened, and where a given line in a given revision
%came from, and it will do so without ever having to embed additional
%meta data in its repositories. Absolutely everything can (and should)
%be inferred.
%
%Git breaks the mould because it thinks about content, not files. It
%doesn't track renames, it tracks content. And it does so at a
%whole-tree level. This is a radical departure from most version
%control systems. It doesn't bother trying to store per-file histories;
%it instead stores the history at the tree level. When you perform a
%diff you are comparing two trees, not two files.
%
%As a result of this fundamental design decision, the structure of a
%Git repository is stunningly simple. It's so simple in fact, that
%you'll be surprised at the sophistication of the things you can do
%with it. But that's the way the best code will always be: simple,
%solid premises out of which complex applications arise.
%
%The other fundamentally smart design decision is how Git does merges.
%The merging algorithms are smart but they don't try to be too smart.
%Unambiguous decisions are made automatically, but when there's doubt
%it's up to the user to decide. This is the way it should be. You don't
%want a machine making those decisions for you. You never will want it.
%That's the fundamental insight in the Git approach to merging: while
%every other version control system is trying to get smarter, Git is
%happily self-described as the "stupid content manager", and it's
%better for it."

\section{Commit history walker}
\l make it a chapter? Walking a Repository?
\n renamed commit history walker so less confusing with object store walker?

% actually a DAG of commits, not a graph of commits.

\t used outside git log? so just put inside git log?

\subsection{Basic walker}

<<signature [[Commit.walk_history]]>>=
val walk_history:  
  (hash -> t) -> (hash -> t -> unit) -> hash ->
  unit
@
<<function [[Commit.walk_history]]>>=

let walk_history read_commit f sha =
  (* we are walking a DAG, so we need to remember already processed nodes *)
  let hdone = Hashtbl.create 101 in
  let rec aux sha =
    if Hashtbl.mem hdone sha
    then ()
    else begin
      Hashtbl.add hdone sha true;
      let commit = read_commit sha in
      (* todo: path matching *)
      f sha commit;
      commit.parents |> List.iter aux
    end
  in
  aux sha
(* 
let walk_graph r f =
  let heads = 
    Repository.all_refs r |> Common.map_filter (fun aref ->
      if aref =~ "refs/heads/"
      then Some (Repository.follow_ref_some r (Refs.Ref aref))
      else None
    )
  in
  ...
  heads |> List.iter aux
*)
@

\subsection{Extra features}
\l mv in advanced topics?

\subsubsection{max entries}
% git log -1, -10, useful.

\subsubsection{Reverse walking}
% requires O(n). will call iterator and store result a list.

\subsubsection{Exclude set}

\subsubsection{Time range}

\subsubsection{Path restrictions}

\subsubsection{Topological order}

\chapter{Exchanging}
\label{chap:exchanging}
% Collaborating?
% Sharing and updating

%trans: most commands useful for single developer.
% but VCS really shine when multiple developers, to help
% collaborate. Saw merge that alleviate need for locks
% and enable multiple people to work on same files and reconcile their work.

% In centralized, when you commit it also "publish" to central repo
% for other to see. In distributed, commit and publish are decoupled.
% You commit and then you push somewhere.


% Pulling requires merging. When you diverge on master from the remote,
% then pulling is similar to merging where master and origin/master
% are 2 different branches.
% See my little experiment:
% master/home/pad/tmp/t2 $ git log --graph --oneline --decorate --all
% *   4960dcf (HEAD, master) Merge branch 'master' of /home/pad/tmp/t1

% outside scope of this book. Complex cryptography.
%for more information on SHA1:
% http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~blynn/gitmagic/ch08.html

\subsection{Overview}

% SHA1 is many things: hashing, and secure.
% For hashing, simple, ex: str -> int32 by adding (Knuth gives famous
% hash func?) (and then usually used with modulo to access hashtbl array bucket)
% Secure because hard to reverse (but simple hash can?)
% and cant produce alternate doc with same sig (message digest).
% Secure, but Git does not really care about that. Really care about
% hashing with almost 0 collision.

% Wikipedia says SHA1 follows the principles used for 
% MD4 and MD5 by Ronald Rivest.
% I can explain how it works, but not really why it works.
% Out of scope of this book.

% The MD4 Message Digest Algorithm - Ronald L. Rivest
% CRYPTO 90, Springer Verlag
% Define motivations (but old one), and design goals (good one),
% and implem, but does not explain why it works. Still the algorithm
% is simpler and use less weird constants, so maybe more intuitive to
% see why it works and why it's hard to reverse.

val inflate : ?header:bool -> IO.input -> IO.input
(** wrap an input using "inflate" decompression algorithm. raises [Error] if
  an error occurs (this can only be caused by malformed input data). *)
@
% opposite of deflate.
\t remove ?header everywhere? useful?

% alternative: IO.input -> string? IO.input -> unit output -> unit?
% Maybe, but input -> input is nice because can put inflate in the
% middle like in a pipe. Transparent! A single like and hop
% you handle compressed input instead of regular input.

% So deflate should be 'a output -> 'a output? no, because
% need also input for deflate.
% You have a flow of (uncompressed) data, and you want to output
% a flow of compressed data in the pipe.

\subsection{Overview}

%https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFLATE
%RFC 1951 for deflate file format (great)
%RFC 1950 for zlib format which adds adler-32 checksum for data corruption
% detection. zlib stream.
%http://zlib.net/feldspar.html great article on DEFLATE: 

% Deflate is a Mix of Huffman encoding with LZ77 sliding-window compression.
% Deflate is a very well engineered and optimized algorithm.

%https://www.cs.duke.edu/courses/spring03/cps296.5/papers/ziv_lempel_1977_universal_algorithm.pdf
% implemented in ocaml by Gazanaire (and used in decompress later)

% More efficient than 'compress' (which uses LZW)
% https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Welch
% Used by gzip, zlib library, GIF, PNG, and of course DOS pkzip.

\section{Diff3}
\label{sec:diff3-algo}
% aka merge

\subsection{Overview}

% No paper really explaining diff3 algorithm. There is the diffutils manual
% and some comments in the source code according to Pierce's Diff3 
% formalization paper.


% https://blog.jcoglan.com/2017/05/08/merging-with-diff3/

% see example from Pierce paper.
% had to change A to 1 7 8 2 3 6  because if put 1 4 5 2 3 6
% then Diff_myers output a different result than the one they show
% in their paper (there are indeed 2 possible lcs)

\chapter{Advanced Commands TODO}
\label{chap:advanced-commands}

\section{Tagging a commit with a name}
\label{sec:tags}

% Why need tags? Why not simply refs?
% Because refs just point to something but can not have meta-data.
% If you dont want to give any comment about a version and that
% its name is enough, then you just need a ref. Otherwise
% you need a ref to an object (container) containing itself
% ref to a version and metadata: The tag.

% As opposed to a ref (or branch), it always refer to the same commit!
% Just a name to a commit. Also can have a description text.

% Can do tags by abusing refs/tags/xxx. In fact in pfff seems like
% github did that to create tags ...

\subsection{[[Tag.t]]}

<<[[Objects.t]] cases>>=
(*  | Tag of Tag.t *)
@

<<[[Repository.objectish]] cases>>=
(* ObjByTag *)
@

\subsection{Reading a tag}

<<[[Objects.read()]] match str cases>>=
(* "tag" -> Tag (Tag.read raw) *)
@

\subsection{Writing a tag}

<<[[Objects.write()]] match obj cases>>=
@
<<[[Objects.write()]] return header, match obj cases>>=
@

<<[[Cmd_show.show()]] match obj cases>>=
@

\subsection{[[git tag]]}

% to create, list, delete

\subsection{[[git clone]] and tags}
% should import tags

\subsection{[[git pull]] and tags}
% should split_commit_and_tags (see dulwich)

\section{Reference history}
%Storing past versions of the heads: the reflog

% Saw commit history with git log.
% Can have also reference history! with git reflog.

% quite simple, just an history of the content of a ref.
% So very meta, refs allow to access the history of files,
% and the refs themselves have an history.
% so .git/logs/HEAD will contain the different values of HEAD
% so when you switch branch, when you commit, etc., all of that
% will generate different entries there.

% but code of dulwich does not maintain reflog. When you
% update a ref, it should update the reflog of this ref!

\subsection{[[git reflog]]}

\section{Stash}
% again, just a ref?

\subsection{[[git stash]]}
% pretty useful in the end

\section{Developer commands}
% To help develop, to help debug

%trans:
% not only manage changes, go to past versions.
% Can also help debug issues. Can help developer develop!

%\subsection{Identifying the version of a buggy program}
% Useful to get version from binary version!
% RCS had this with $Id$ and ident program.
% Git does not support $Id: as in CVS.
% Alternative?? 
% No $Log:, but anyway can use git log.
% other useful keywords?

\subsection{Finding the diff causing a regression: [[git bisect]]}
% great tool, I should use it more, but requires discipline
% and good commits with good hooks

% How goes when multiple paths between 2 versions (diamond)?

\subsection{Reverting a change: [[git revert]]}
% 

%dup: inspecting/archeology?
\t Undo power

\subsection{Finding the author of some code: [[git blame]]}
% aka annotate

% great tool again. See who, why, and also see related changes!
% Can infer what to do by looking at past commit
% (see my facebook experience!)

% related: git log <path>

%\chapter{Development Support}
% Tags
% Hooks
 
\subsection{Finding code: [[git grep]]}
% pretty useful

\subsection{Creating an archive: [[git archive]]}
% create tarball from git repo
%bootstrap:
% can greate ocamlgit-0.1.tgz so no need git to get ocamlgit

\section{Advanced merging commands}

\subsection{Rebase: [[git rebase]]}

% Cite GitFlow blob controversy?

\subsection{Cherry-pick: [[git cherry-pick]]}

%:darcs: %pijul: better for that
% src: https://pijul.org/manual/why_pijul.html
% when cherry picking git changes the commit. 
% It does not have the same parent and so not
% same commit id, and so later this can cause pb because git
% has no way to know when merging that this patch is common.


\section{Plumbing commands}
% original git is plumbing vs porcelain

\subsection{[[git fetch]]}

\subsection{[[git symbolic-ref]]}

\subsection{[[git rev-list]]}
% 'git log' used to be a shell script calling git rev-list

\subsection{[[git diff-tree]]}

\subsection{Quiet}

\subsection{Thin pack}

\subsection{Side band 64k}



\chapter{Advanced Topics TODO}
\label{chap:advanced-topics}

\section{Bytes versus ASCII versus UTF-8}
% Encoding.

% Git doc says git is agnostic to encoding. Just treat filenames
% and file content as bytes. But for commit messages, assume utf8,
% if not then have to specify an encoding commit tag?

% Why need speak about encoding early?
% Can not just use bytes everywhere? filenames mentionned in
% tree objects are utf8? the content of blob might be utf8 but we do not care.


\section{Reliability and signals}

% First, immutable object store and order of operation (a la ext2fs?)
% leaves state of repo in consistent state always!
% Only tricky part is update references! and done via lock to be atomic.

% What if C-c in middle of operations?
% Handled by atomic ref update?

%\section{Advanced features}
% now in separate chapter

\section{Optimizations}

%\subsection{LRU cache}
% Needs that for?

\section{Fast import and export}
% another opti? why need that?
% to collaborate with other VCS? like import SVN in git?

% another way to clone a repo?
%$ git fast-export --all | (cd /empty/repository && git fast-import)

\section{Alternates}

\t ??? related to pack files?

%\section{Peeled}
% seems related to tags, so move with Tags?
%https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26492303/what-does-peel-mean-in-git

\section{Other repository format}

\subsection{Bare repository}

% convenient when want to have a centralized repo and
% people push to it. If non-bare repo then git refuses to push
% because the index and worktree would be inconsistent.

% when git init --bare

% when objects/ directly at root, not under hidden_path (controldir).

\subsection{[[.git]] file}
% linked working tree? see docstring of commondir()


\section{Security}

% Ownership?
% Less an issue with git because distribute VCS, so anybody
% can have own copy of entire repo (not just of work tree).
% So no need special admin of RCS/foo.c,v 

%rcs: rely on unix permission (give foo.c,v to a group) and
% can have additional access (restriction list)

% How protect who can modify a repo?
%sccs: could even limit to certain dirs or files what someone could modify
