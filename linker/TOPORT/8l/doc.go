8l is a modified version of the Plan 9 linker.  The original is documented at

	http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/1/2l

Its target architecture is the x86, referred to by these tools for historical reasons as 386.
It reads files in .8 format generated by 8g, 8c, and 8a and emits
a binary called 8.out by default.

Major changes include:
	- support for ELF and Mach-O binary files
	- support for segmented stacks (this feature is implemented here, not in the compilers).


Original options are listed in the link above.

Options new in this version:

-d
	Elide the dynamic linking header.  With this option, the binary
	is statically linked and does not refer to dynld.  Without this option
	(the default), the binary's contents are identical but it is loaded with dynld.
-H6
	Write Apple Mach-O binaries (default when $GOOS is darwin)
-H7
	Write Linux ELF binaries (default when $GOOS is linux)
-L dir1,dir2,..
	Search for libraries (package files) in the comma-separated list of directories.
	The default is the single location $GOROOT/pkg/$GOOS_386.
-r dir1:dir2:...
	Set the dynamic linker search path when using ELF.
-V
	Print the linker version.
